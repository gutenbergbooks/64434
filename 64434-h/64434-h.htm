<p>In the hope of promoting the diffusion of a taste for the cultivation of a peculiarly
interesting and attractive branch of Natural History, I have been induced, in compliance
with the suggestion of the eminent publisher of this volume, to arrange in a connected
series the Plates of the late Mr. Parkinson's "<span class="smcap">Organic Remains of a Former
World</span>," and of Mr. Artis's "<span class="smcap">Antediluvian Phytology</span>," with descriptions of the
specimens represented.</p>

<p>As I have been enabled, with the valuable assistance of my friend, John Morris,
Esq. F.G.S., the author of "<span class="smcap">A Catalogue of British Fossils</span>," to append, in almost
every instance, the generic and specific names adopted by the most recent authorities, the
volume will, I trust, not only prove interesting to the general reader, as a beautiful
<i>Pictorial Atlas</i> of some of the most remarkable relics of the animals and plants of
a "Former World," but also constitute a valuable book of reference in the library
of the Geologist and Palæontologist, since it contains the names and localities of no
inconsiderable number of species and genera.</p>

<p>For the guidance of the unscientific reader who may desire further information
on any of the subjects treated of in the following pages, references are given to a few
general works on Geology and Fossil Remains.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="caption3">THE MOA OF NEW ZEALAND.</p>

<p>The <a href="#Frontispiece">Frontispiece</a> represents the entire series of bones composing the right foot of the Moa (<i>Dinornis
robustus</i>), found imbedded in an erect position, with the corresponding foot a yard in advance, in a turbary
deposit, at Waikouaiti, in the Middle Island of New Zealand, in 1849. The figures are one-third less in linear
dimensions than the originals.</p>

<p>Figures 1<sup><i>a</i></sup>, 2<sup><i>a</i></sup>, 3<sup><i>a</i></sup>, show the palmar, or under surface of the respective toes, and exhibit the trochlear
or articulating extremities of the phalangeal bones.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The ancient swamp or morass in which these matchless specimens were imbedded, is situated on the shore,
in a little creek or bay near Island Point, at the mouth of the river Waikouaiti, and is covered by the sea except
at the lowest tides. Many remains of the largest species of Moa have from time to time been obtained from this
deposit; the bones sent to England by Dr. Mackellar, Mr. Percy Earle, and others, figured and described in the
Zoological Transactions by Professor Owen, were from this locality.</p>

<p>The specimens figured were obtained by Mr. Walter Mantell, in 1849, when visiting Waikouaiti, as Government
Commissioner for the settlement of Native claims. On the recession of the tide, the upper (or proximal)
ends of the metatarsals were just visible above the surface: these were carefully dug up, and all the bones
of the respective toes numbered, one by one, as they were extracted from the soil. In this state they were sent
to me, and have subsequently been articulated under my direction, in their natural order of arrangement.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> By the well-known eminent anatomical artist, Mr. Flower, of 22, Lambeth Terrace, Lambeth Road.</p></div>

<p>The condition and position of the bones, and the nature of the deposit,&mdash;evidently an ancient morass,
in which the New Zealand flax (<i>phormium tenax</i>) once grew luxuriantly,&mdash;remind us of the very similar circumstances
in which the extinct gigantic Elks in Ireland, and the Mastodons in America, have occasionally been
found engulfed in peat bogs and morasses; and, as my son emphatically observes, it is impossible to arrive
at any other conclusion than that the Moa to which these feet belonged, had sunk down in the swamp, and
perished on the spot. Vertebræ and other parts of a skeleton of a bird of the same proportions, were dug up
near the feet.</p>

<p>As the specimens under examination are the first examples in which the entire series of the phalangeal
and ungueal bones have been found in natural connexion with the metatarsals, I subjoin the admeasurements
of the several parts, to render the peculiar construction of the feet in one species of the lost race of the
colossal birds of New Zealand, more obvious to those who may feel interested in the subject.</p>

<p>The total length of the toes is as follows:&mdash;inner digit, 9&frac12; inch.; middle, 11&frac12; inch.; outer, 9<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> inch. The
transverse diameter of the expanse of the foot, from the distal extremity of the inner toe (fig. 1<sup>a</sup>), to that of the
outer one (fig. 3<sup>a</sup>), is 15&frac12; inches. The length from the posterior part of the trochlear extremity of the metatarsal
to the distal end of the ungueal of the middle toe (fig. 2<sup>a</sup>), is 13 inches. If to the actual dimensions of the bones be
added the proportional thickness of the cartilaginous integuments, nails, &amp;c., the length of the foot of the living
bird may be estimated at about 16 inches, and the breadth at 17 or 18 inches.</p>

<p>From the great width and solidity of the metatarsals, and the form and corresponding size and strength of the
phalangeals and ungueals, the ornithologist will perceive that the feet of the Moa must have constituted powerful
instruments for scratching, digging, and uprooting the sub-terrestrial vegetable substances, which Professor Owen,
with great probability, infers, formed the chief sustenance of the extinct colossal birds of New Zealand.</p>

<p>According to the relative proportions of the bones composing the hinder extremities of the gigantic species
of Moa, the corresponding <i>tibia</i>, or leg-bone, of the feet above described, would be two feet nine inches in length,
and the <i>femur</i>, or thigh bone, nine and a half inches; the total height of the bird was probably about ten feet.</p>

<p>Tibiæ, femora, and other bones of much larger proportions, (apparently of <i>Dinornis giganteus</i> and <i>D. ingens</i>,)
were obtained from the same locality; some of these indicate birds of eleven or twelve feet in height;
dimensions exceeding by one-third those of the largest known existing species of Struthionidæ&mdash;the Ostrich.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Even from this imperfect description (and further anatomical details would be irrelevant in the present work), the ornithologist cannot
fail to observe the peculiar characters exhibited by these extremities of the remarkable family of birds, of which the diminutive Apteryx appears
to be the only living representative. But the Apteryx differs most essentially in the structure of the cranium and mandibles, from the extinct
types to which Professor Owen has given the names of Dinornis, Palapteryx, Aptornis, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
With regard to the construction of the feet it may be further remarked, that the length of the inner and outer toes is nearly equal, as in
the Cassowary; but the middle toe, which in the Cassowary is one-third longer than the other digits, in the Moa scarcely exceeds in length
by one-fifth, the inner and outer toes. The ungueal segments are very large, being equal to one-third the length of the toes. The phalangeals
are relatively much shorter than in the Cassowary and Ostrich, and wider than in the former, and more arched than in either of these living
struthious birds.
</p>

<p>
In the metatarsal the presence of the three elements whose fusion constitutes the bone, is strongly marked; there does not appear to be
any certain indications of a posterior or hind toe, though Professor Owen imagines he has detected feeble traces of a fourth digit: in that
case the bird to which my specimens belonged, would be termed <i>Palapteryx</i>. The crania found by Mr. Walter Mantell at Waingongoro, and
figured and described by Professor Owen in the Zoological Transactions (Vol. III., Plates 52, 53, 54, 55), as Dinornis and Palapteryx,
must have belonged to birds of comparatively small stature. The skull with the adze-like upper mandible, and the enormously-developed
<i>basi-occipitals</i> and <i>basi-sphenoids</i> (<i>Dinornis</i>, of Professor Owen, Plate 53), was found associated with many vertebræ of the neck and back,
and bones of the leg, of the same bird; and these my son states indicated a height of from six to seven feet. The skull and the rest of the
skeleton were found imbedded in sand, and lying in their natural relative position; unfortunately, all these precious remains, except the
cranium, were destroyed by a sudden rush of the natives to seize upon the exhumed relics! It therefore yet remains to discover the cranial
type that characterized the colossal forms at present known only by other parts of the skeleton.</p></div>

<p>Referring the reader to the additional account of the fossil birds of New Zealand given in a subsequent part
of this volume (see <i>Supplementary Notes</i>, <a href="#SupNote_4">p. 173</a>), I will conclude this notice with a few general remarks. From the
numerous facts relating to the fossil remains of birds from our Antipodean colony, that have now been brought
under the consideration of the naturalists and geologists of this country, we may safely conclude, that at a period
geologically recent, but of immense antiquity in relation to the human inhabitants of those Islands, New Zealand
was densely peopled by tribes of colossal struthious bipeds, of species and genera that have long since become
extinct. I believe that ages ere the advent of the Maori tribes, the Moa and its kindred were the chief
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[ xii ]</a></span>
inhabitants of the country, and that from the period when those Islands were taken possession of by man,
the race gradually diminished, and the colossal types were finally annihilated by human agency. That some
of the largest species were contemporary with the Maories, there can now be no reasonable doubt. Apart from
native traditions, and songs and tales in which allusions are made to the gigantic magnitude and flowing
plumage of the Moa, the collocation of calcined and half roasted bones of the Dinornis, of dogs, and of the human
species, in the ancient fire-heaps of the aborigines, and the unequivocal marks of the celt or axe of jade on some
of the tibiæ,&mdash;the chips or cuts having evidently been made on the bones when recent,&mdash;afford incontrovertible
proof that the last of the Moas, like the last of the Dodos, was annihilated by human agency.</p>

<p>From the remarkable size and strength of the thighs, legs, and feet of the Moas, it is clear that the hinder
limbs must have constituted powerful locomotive organs; and when we consider the vast swarms of the largest
species which existed at some remote period, it seems highly probable that this family of colossal birds,&mdash;a
family unknown in any other part of the world,&mdash;was not originally confined within the narrow geographical
limits of modern New Zealand, but ranged over a vast continent now submerged, and of which Phillip and
Norfolk Islands, and Chatham and Auckland Islands, and those of New Zealand, are the culminating points.</p>

<p>But whatever may be the result of future discoveries as to the relative age of the bone-deposits, or the
existence or extinction of any of the colossal species of Moa, or the former extension of the race over countries
now submerged, one astounding fact must ever remain unassailable&mdash;the vast preponderance of the class Aves
or Birds, that prevailed, and which still prevails, in the fauna of New Zealand, to the almost entire exclusion
of mammalia and reptiles. Any palæontologist who saw only the collections sent over by my son, must have
been astonished at their extent and variety. I may venture to affirm that such an assemblage of the fossil
bones of birds was never before seen in Europe: nearly fifteen hundred specimens, collected from various parts
of the country, with scarcely any intermixture of the remains of any other class;&mdash;it is a phenomenon as startling
as the exclusively reptilian character of the fauna of the Wealden epoch. But the fauna of New Zealand, even
at the present time, presents a character as ornithic and as anomalous as its ancient one; for while there are
upwards of fifty or sixty genera of birds, there is but <span class="smcap">one</span> indigenous mammalian quadruped known to naturalists&mdash;a
species of rat! In this respect, therefore, as well as in its flora, in which ferns and other cellulosæ of
peculiar types prevail to an extent unknown elsewhere, the country offers a striking example of that now
acknowledged fact in natural history&mdash;a centre or focus of creation of certain organic types. And this law,
with whose operation during the palæozoic and secondary ages modern geological researches have made us
familiar, appears to have continued in unabated energy to the present moment.</p>

<p>From what has been advanced, it is manifest that the present geographical distribution of special groups
of terrestrial animals and plants, displays as many anomalies in the relative predominance of the different classes
and orders over certain areas, without relation to climatorial or other obvious physical conditions, as can be traced
in the natural records of the earlier ages of the world. The conclusion therefore forces itself upon the mind, that
throughout the vast periods of time to which our retrospective knowledge extends, the geological changes of
the earth's surface, and the appearance and obliteration of species and genera, have been governed by the same
physical and organic laws; and that notwithstanding the variable conditions of the land and the water, indicated
by the sedimentary formations, there was at no period a greater discrepancy in the assemblages of certain types
of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, than exists at present.</p>

<p>Of the nature of that law by which the extinction of a race of highly organized beings is determined, and
whose effects through innumerable ages palæontology has in part revealed, we are as utterly ignorant as of that
which governs the first appearance of the minutest living animalcule which the powers of the microscope enable
us to descry; both are veiled in inscrutable mystery, the results only are within the scope of our finite
comprehension.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The publication of Mr. Parkinson's "<i>Organic Remains of a former World</i>," at the commencement
of the present century, must be regarded as a memorable event in the history of British
Palæontology: it was the first attempt to give a familiar and scientific account of the fossil relics
of animals and plants, accompanied by figures of the specimens described.</p>

<p>The three volumes<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of which the work consisted, appeared at considerable intervals; the last
was published in 1811. Although nearly forty years have since elapsed, and hundreds of
geological works, of all kinds and degrees of merit, have subsequently been issued, Mr. Parkinson's
Plates, owing to their fidelity and beauty, are still in such request, as to induce the proprietor,
Mr. Bohn, now that the work is out of print, to publish them, with the descriptions
and modern names of the fossils represented.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Three volumes, in 4to.; price 10<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i></p></div>

<p>I have added a few explanatory remarks, and in the "<a href="#SUPPLEMENTARY_NOTES"><span class="smcap">Supplementary Notes</span></a>," have given
extended notices of some of the most interesting subjects, with the view of rendering the volume
more intelligible and acceptable to the general reader.</p>

<p>In looking through the original work of Mr. Parkinson, the instructed observer will not fail
to perceive the immense progress which the study of fossil animals and plants has made since
the period of its first appearance in 1811. At that time, the terms Geology and Palæontology
were unknown; all the sedimentary strata have since been accurately defined and arranged, and
names assigned to the respective systems or formations; while the so-called <i>Diluvial Epoch</i>, which
Mr. Parkinson, and even Baron Cuvier, considered as established by incontrovertible physical
evidence, has been expunged from the chronology of geology. In Mr. Parkinson's volumes, no
allusion will be found to that most remarkable era in the earth's history which modern researches
have brought to light&mdash;<i>the Age of Reptiles</i>; the terms Ichthyosauri, Plesiosauri, Iguanodon, Megalosaurus&mdash;now
familiar as household words&mdash;are not inscribed on their pages; all those marvellous
beings of past ages have been discovered during the last forty years; in short, the remark
of an eminent critic is as true as it is beautiful:&mdash;"Geology is a philosophy which never rests; its
law is progress; a point which yesterday was invisible is its goal to-day, and will be its starting-post
to-morrow."</p>

<p>I gladly avail myself of this opportunity to make a passing allusion to the excellent and
accomplished author, Mr. Parkinson. I had the pleasure and privilege of his acquaintance
in my youth, immediately after the publication of the third volume of his valuable work. Mr.
Parkinson was rather below the middle stature, with an energetic, intelligent, and pleasing
expression of countenance, and of mild and courteous manners; readily imparting information,
either on his favourite science, or on professional subjects; for he was at that time actively
engaged in medical practice in Hoxton Square, and was the author of several valuable medical
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[ 14 ]</a></span>
treatises. He kindly showed and explained to me the principal objects in his cabinets, and
pointed out every source of information on fossil remains; a department of natural knowledge at
that time but little cultivated in England, but which peculiar circumstances had contributed to
render the engrossing object of my young and ardent mind. In after years Mr. Parkinson
warmly encouraged my attempts to elucidate the nature of the strata and organic remains of my
native county, Sussex, a district which was then supposed to be destitute of geological interest;
and he revised my drawings, and favoured me with his remarks on many subjects treated of in
my first work&mdash;"<i>The Fossils of the South Downs</i>."<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Published in 1822.</p></div>

<p>In 1822, Mr. Parkinson published "An Introduction to the Study of Fossil Organic Remains,
especially of those found in the British Strata; intended to aid the Student in his Inquiries
respecting the Nature of Fossils, and their Connexion with the Formation of the Earth;" 1 vol.
8vo. with ten plates, principally of the genera of fossil shells. He also contributed a few papers
to the early volumes of the Geological Society of London, of which he was one of the original
members. After Mr. Parkinson's death, his beautiful and choice collection was sold by auction,
and its contents widely dispersed. The fine series of silicified zoophytes was purchased by Mr.
Featherstonhaugh, and taken to America; and some years afterwards was destroyed by a fire
which consumed the museum in which it was placed.</p>

<p>As illustrative of the pleasing style of Mr. Parkinson's work, I subjoin an abstract of the
chapter, <i>On the Pleasure and Advantages of a Knowledge of Fossil Remains</i>. The epistolary style
was adopted; and the first letter is supposed to be penned by a friend desirous of learning the
nature of certain fossils he had observed on his journey to Oxford:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have lived long enough to witness many sad disappointments to the fond dreams of
happiness indulged by persons who, only intent on the acquisition of riches, had neglected to
cultivate any intellectual or ennobling pursuit; so that on retiring from active life, they were
unable to enjoy the leisure so dearly earned by years of anxiety and care, and either relapsed
into a state of miserable ennui, or gave themselves up to the excitement of frivolous or vicious
indulgences.</p>

<p>"Aware of the necessity of devoting the few leisure hours, which the duties of my calling left
at my disposal, to some rational and amusing occupation, I have always cultivated, more or less
assiduously, some branch of art or science, and thence acquired an enthusiastic admiration for the
beauties of nature, and an insatiable curiosity to pry into the mysteries of the natural world.
With this state of mind, I have at length resolved to avail myself of the means my little
fortune affords me to indulge those feelings, and have, I trust, quitted the busy scenes of
the world for ever.</p>

<p>"In pursuance of a plan long entertained of visiting the most interesting parts of our island,
I left London last week, accompanied by my daughter, and our old friend, Frank Wilton, whose
lively disposition and agreeable manners render him, as you well know, an excellent companion.
But he has made himself most acceptable to us on another account;&mdash;his resolute scepticism with
respect to the more rational, and his submissive credulity as to the popular and traditional
explanations of such natural phenomena as are beyond his comprehension, are frequently
productive of remarks so quaint and humorous, as to contribute in no small degree to our
enjoyment.</p>

<p>"Ere our first day's journey was completed, I discovered how insufficient was the knowledge
I possessed to enable me to form even a conjecture, as to the nature of the very first
objects which particularly arrested our attention. We were within a few miles of Oxford, when
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[ 15 ]</a></span>
Wilton, looking out of the carriage window, exclaimed, 'Bless me! never before did I see roads
mended with such materials!' This, of course, drew my attention to what had so strongly
excited his wonder; and I must confess that my astonishment was but little less than his own;
for I beheld a labourer with a large hammer breaking to pieces a nearly circular ornamented
stone, half as large as the fore-wheel of our carriage, and resembling in form a coiled-up serpent,
or snake. We instantly stopped the chaise, and inquired of the man the name of the stone,
and where it came from. 'This, Sir,' he replied, 'is a <i>snake-stone</i>, and comes from yonder
quarry, where there are thousands of them.' Upon hearing this, we all alighted, and with
surprise examined some of the unbroken stones, which, though evidently bearing the form of
an unknown animal, were composed of solid rock. As we sauntered along, the carriage
following us, we came to a neat building on the road-side, which a sign in the hedge opposite
denoted to be a house of public entertainment. Hoping to gain more satisfactory information
respecting the objects that had so much excited our curiosity, we entered this literally hedge
ale-house, and on being shown into a neat room, the casement of which, surrounded by roses
and honeysuckles in full bloom, opened into a garden redolent with fragrance and beauty,
from the wild profusion of its flowers and shrubs, we determined to rest awhile, and partake of
such refreshment as the cottage might afford. While these were preparing, Frank Wilton,
whose restless curiosity leaves nothing unobserved, was examining the contents of the old oaken
mantel-shelf, and suddenly cried out, 'Well! if the object of travelling is to behold novelties
and wonders, surely this county will afford that gratification in the highest degree; for among
the curious things on this mantel-piece, there is not one of which I have ever seen its like
before.' The articles now passed under my examination, and with no better success; for
I had never observed anything similar, nor could I form a rational conjecture respecting their
nature.</p>

<p>"While thus engaged, our landlady made her appearance, and from her we learnt that this
was her collection of curiosities, gathered from the neighbouring country; and she readily
imparted to us all she knew of the subject. Taking up one of the stones, which resembled those
we had seen on the road,&mdash;'This,' she said, 'is a petrified snake, with which this neighbourhood
abounds. These were once fairies that inhabited these parts, and, for their crimes, were
turned first into snakes, and then into stones. Here'&mdash;showing a stone of a conical form&mdash;'is
one of the fairies' night-caps,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> now also become stone.' 'Do, madam,' addressing Emma,
'pray observe this pattern; is it possible lace-work like this should ever have been worked by
human hands? This&mdash;and this&mdash;are pieces of bones of giants, who lived here after the fairies
were destroyed.' These bones, she informed us, were frequently dug up in several parts of
the county, as well as innumerable <i>thunderbolts</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> some of which she also showed us, affirming that
they were the very thunderbolts by which the giants were in their turn annihilated.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> A Cidaris, or turban-echinite; see <a href="#Plate_53">Plate LIII</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> <i>Belemnites</i>, popularly termed "thunderbolts," <a href="#Plate_59">Plate LIX</a>.</p></div>

<p>"We all listened attentively to this discourse, and on my smiling, when she withdrew, at the
romantic account we had received, Wilton strenuously defended our good landlady's narration,
and declared, he thought it was not without a fair share of probability. On the return of our
hostess, I did not venture to express any doubt of the truth of her story, but merely requested
to know if she was aware of there being anywhere a more extensive collection of similar
curiosities. 'To be sure. Sir,' she replied, 'our University has a museum full of them; and
if you be going through Oxford, it will be well worth your while to see it.'</p>

<p>"After taking refreshment, we left our kind and communicative hostess, but not with an
intention of immediately visiting the Museum of the University. On the contrary, I felt that,
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[ 16 ]</a></span>
without some previous knowledge of the objects to be examined, our curiosity would be only
excited, not gratified; and I resolved to defer our visit to Oxford, until we had obtained the
information necessary to insure us both pleasure and profit in the investigation of the relics of
interest it contained.</p>

<p>"Thus, my dear friend, at the very outset of my long anticipated holidays, I have experienced
considerable disappointment, and I confidently appeal to you to afford me the information
I require; for I know that you have successfully cultivated the science which teaches the
nature of these figured stones, or petrifactions, and possess a valuable collection of these most
extraordinary objects. You now, therefore, have it in your power to add greatly to the delight
and instruction I am anticipating from my travels, by giving me an insight into the origin and
nature of the petrified remains which, I am told, are every where to be met with in the districts
we are about to visit."</p>

<p>Of Mr. Artis's Work, I need only mention that it was intended, as its title expresses, to
illustrate "<i>The Fossil Remains of Plants peculiar to the Coal Formations of Great Britain; selected
for their novelty and interest from upwards of a Thousand Specimens in the possession of the Author</i>;
by Edmund Tyrell Artis, Esq. F.S.A. F.G.S." It was published by Nichols &amp; Son, 1838.
The plates are well executed, and faithfully portray the original specimens.</p>

petrifaction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span> Silicified wood, having a cavity lined with mammillated chalcedony; appearing as if
the silex had percolated through the substance of the mass, and had slowly oozed

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span> Silicified bituminous wood. In this specimen the siliceous matter occurs in yellow
semi-pellucid globules; the colour is supposed to have been derived from the
bitumen.</p></div>

<p>The silicified woods delineated above, belong to the division which Mr. Parkinson denominated
opaline; he conceived their peculiar characters to have resulted from an infiltration of
fluid silex into the ligneous tissue, which, having previously undergone bituminization, was
in a permeable state; hence originated the conchoidal fracture and peculiar resinous lustre
which these specimens exhibit.</p>

<p>The specimen, fig. 7, Mr. Parkinson describes as corroborating the opinion that the ligneous
tissues were converted into a bituminous substance, and subsequently impregnated with siliceous
matter. "In that fossil there is a knot of wood which differs not the least in appearance from
that in a recent piece, but it is perfectly impregnated with opaline silex. Is it possible that
the change this knot has suffered could have been effected by an abstraction of the greater part
or of the whole of its constituent molecules, and a substitution of particles of a different nature?
Its hardness and closeness of texture oppose an insuperable bar to the supposition: whilst the
mysteriousness of the change is entirely dispelled by admitting of the softening operation of
bituminization, and consequent admission of silex in a fluid state."&mdash;<i>Mr. Parkinson</i>.</p>

<p>These fossil fruits, which Mr. Parkinson considered as belonging to a species of Cocos, or
Cocoa, and M. Brongniart referred to the Pandanus or Screw-pine, Mr. Bowerbank has demonstrated
to be closely related to the recent <i>Nipa</i>, or Malucca Palm; a low shrub-like monocotyledonous
plant, that inhabits marshy tracts near the mouths of great rivers, particularly where
the waters are brackish.</p>

<p>Mr. Bowerbank has figured and described eleven species. The species represented in this
plate is distinguished as <i>Nipadites Parkinsonis</i>: M. Brongniart had previously named it
<i>Pandanocarpum Parkinsonis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The following is Mr. Bowerbank's description of these fossils:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The fruits of which the group I propose to name <i>Nipadites</i> is composed, are known among
the women and children by whom they are usually collected, by the name of '<i>petrified figs</i>.'
The epicarp and endocarp are thin and membranous; the sarcocarp is thick and pulpy, composed of
cellular tissue, through which run numerous bundles of vessels. The cells are about the <sup>8</sup>/<sub>100</sub>th
part of an inch in diameter. Nearly in the centre of the pericarp is situated a large seed, which,
when broken, is found to be more or less hollow. It is frequently not more than half a line in
thickness; but in perfect specimens it presents the appearance of a closely granulated structure,
in which small apertures containing carbonaceous matter occasionally occur. The seed in
<i>Nipadites Parkinsonis</i>, consists of regular layers of cells radiating from a spot situated near the
middle of the seed, and apparently enclosing a central embryo.</p>

<p>"If the habits of the plants which produced these fossil fruits were similar to those of the
recent <i>Nipa</i>, it will account for their amazing abundance in the London Clay of the Isle of
Sheppey; which formation, from the great variety of fossilized stems and branches, mixed
up with <i>asteria</i>, <i>mollusca</i>, and <i>conchifera</i> of numerous marine and fresh-water genera, is
strikingly characterized as having been the delta of an immense river, which probably flowed
from near the Equator towards the spot where these interesting remains are now deposited."<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p class="caption4nb">"<span class="smcap">Columnar Hydatica.</span>"</p>

<p>Under the name <i>Hydatica</i>, Mr. Artis has described two species of fossil plants, from the coal-mine
near Wentworth, Yorkshire. The originals appear to have been aquatic plants, having a
horizontal or creeping stem, sending up slender branches, which floated by their leaves on the
surface of the water.</p>

<p>The generic characters are, "Stem, arborescent, jointed, branched; leaves, long, linear."</p>

<p>In the arrangements of Schlotheim and Brongniart, who consider only the construction of
the leaves, these plants would belong to the genus <i>Poacites</i>.</p>

<p>The species figured is named <i>Hydatica columnaris</i>, or Columnar Hydatica. The stem is
branched all the way up, and ends in a club-like head; the branches are numerous, simple,
alternate, and covered with parallel hair-like leaves.</p>

<p>This species is named by Mr. Artis, <i>Hydatica prostrata</i>. The stem is jointed, and slightly
striated; the joints are formed with irregular sutures, whence arise tufts of linear leaves
resembling those of our common grasses.</p>

<p>Fragments of this fossil plant are abundant in the roofs of several of the chambers whence the

describes the plant under the generic name of <i>Myriophyllites</i>;&mdash;<i>M. gracilis</i>. The stem is herbaceous
and slender, terminating in a point; it is thickly covered with hair-like leaves.</p>

<p>It was found imbedded horizontally, in detached masses, separated from the great mass of
vegetable matter which covers the coal, by an intervening layer of shale. It is rarely met with
in the same bed with other vegetables, but generally in solitary and thin strata, taking a horizontal
position; so that by riving the shale which contains these plants, numbers of them are
disclosed on the same surface. In its general aspect this fossil vegetable resembles the trailing
roots of some aquatic plants.</p>

<p>Long and large jointed stems, generally more or less flattened by compression, and bearing
some resemblance to a cane or bamboo, are very abundant in the coal formations. Some of
them attain many feet in length, and are of a corresponding magnitude in circumference. The
original plants are supposed to have been related to the <i>Equisetaceæ</i>, or Mare's-tail, and not to
the <i>Bambusiæ</i>, and other arborescent grasses. The stem is jointed, and longitudinally striated,
having annular impressions at the articulations.</p>

<p>The present species (<i>Calamites ramosus</i>) has the stem arborescent and branched; the branches
are cylindrical, striated, and inserted at the articulations of the trunk; the articulations of the
branches are surrounded by a striated disk.</p>

<p>The stem has been found nine feet in length, and occurs both horizontally and vertically, in
sandstone, in Leabrook Quarry, near Wentworth.</p>

<p>These fossil stems are from the same sandstone quarry as the Calamite delineated in the
previous plate.</p>

<p>They differ in some respects from the usual type of the genus, hence the specific name
(<i>Calamites dubius</i>). The striæ are narrow, and have a fine groove running down the middle; the
fifth or sixth articulation is surrounded by a double line of large globular indentations, one row
belonging to each of the connected joints; these imprints have apparently been left by a zone
of some organs which surrounded the articulations, and by its pressure left the indented frill,
shown in the upper extremity of fig. 2.</p>

<p>These stems are generally found compressed, and from two to three feet in length. Their
termination is unknown.</p>

bed of very good coal; and at a considerable depth below this bed, there is a second layer of
coal, eight feet thick, which is covered in particular places with immense masses of fossil plants."</p>

<p>The species here figured very closely resembles the Bamboos. The stem is arborescent, and
marked with parallel linear strife, which are intercepted at the sutures; it is simple and cylindrical,
and contracted at the articulations; it occurs five feet or more in length.</p>

<p>This species of Calamite is characterized by the shortness and number of the joints; these are
intercepted by distinct articulations, and have small compressed tubercles, forming a studded row
round the trunk. The articulations are about one-fifth the diameter of the stem apart. The
tubercular studs, or warts, are probably the cicatrices of fallen leaves; they rise directly from the
articulations, and not from the lower termination of the striæ, as in the species figured in

<p>In this species of Calamite the joints are short, and decrease in length towards the summit,
where they terminate in an enlarged rounded head. The striæ are ornamented with tubercles at
the bottom, close to the articulation. The striæ are broader, and the tubercles larger, towards
the summit.</p>

<p>The stem is sometimes found two feet long, and from two to four inches in diameter.</p>

<p>The situation of the tubercles at the lower extremity of the striæ, is a striking feature of this

<p>Stems more or less flattened, with the external surface longitudinally furrowed, and uniformly
ornamented with rows of deeply imprinted symmetrical figures, disposed with much regularity,
are among the most abundant vegetable remains in the coal formation. These are named
<i>Sigillariæ</i>, from the Latin word <i>sigillum</i>, signifying a <i>seal</i>, in allusion to the extreme regularity
of the imprints on the surface. When found in an upright position, at right angles to the plane of
the stratum, the original cylindrical form of the tree is commonly preserved; and many examples
are now known of groups of erect Sigillariæ, with their roots extending into the surrounding
clay or sandy loam; the roots proving to be the fossil bodies called <i>Stigmariæ</i>, which were formerly
supposed to be a distinct family of aquatic plants.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The first discovery of this highly interesting

<p>The specimen figured was found in an erect position in the sandstone of a quarry at Rowmarsh,
near Rotherham in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>The stem is simple, the furrows small and wavy, impressed with dots on the ridges. The
cicatrices are ovate, subpentagonal, with the lower angles rounded, having a single gland near
the lower extremity. The stem is three feet long, and four inches in diameter.</p>

<p>The transverse section, as seen in fig. 1, shows traces of a double concentric ring, as if
produced by internal structure. Fig. 2, displays the equality of the stem throughout its entire
length, and its abrupt termination. In fig. 3, is seen the cicatrix with its single gland, for the
attachment of the petiole or leaf-stalk. Fig. 4, indicates the undulating line of the top of the
ridge.</p>

<p>"The originals of these fossils are supposed by M. Ad. Brongniart to have constituted a
peculiar family of coniferous plants, now extinct, which probably belonged to the great division
of gymnospermous dicotyledons. In their external forms they somewhat resembled the Cacteæ
or Euphorbiæ, but were more nearly related by their internal organization to the Zamiæ or
Cycadeæ. The leaves and fruits of these trees are unknown, for no satisfactory connexion has
been established between the stems, and the foliage and seed vessels with which they are sometimes

feet, the largest being several inches in diameter. Their surface is covered with numerous
oval or circular depressions, in the middle of each of which there is a rounded papilla, or tubercle.
These variolæ are disposed round the stem in quincunx order. When these roots are broken
across, a small cylindrical core or pith is exposed, which extends in a longitudinal direction
throughout the stem, like a medullary column. This central axis, which is often separable from
the surrounding mass, is composed of bundles of vascular tissue disposed in a radiated manner,
and separated from each other by medullary rays. This internal organization presents the
same correspondence with that of the stems of Sigillariæ, as does the structure of the roots of
a dicotyledonous tree with that of its branches and stems.</p>

<p>The Stigmariæ are almost invariably present in the bed called the "Under Clay," which
underlies the coal, and when observed in this situation, long tapering sub-cylindrical fibres are
found attached to the tubercles; and these processes or rootlets are often several feet in length.
Their form and mode of attachment are shown at <span class="smcap">C, D</span>; the rootlets terminate in bifurcations,
as seen at <span class="smcap">A, B</span>.</p>

<p>The specimen here figured is part of a root nearly six feet long, and three inches in diameter;
some of the rootlets were two feet long. It is imbedded in shale; from Elsecar colliery.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>In this species of Stigmaria the tubercles vary considerably in size, and give a verrucose,

an aquatic plant, having a short dome-shaped trunk, from which radiated numerous long
horizontal branches; and that when the plant was perfect, and the branches floating on the
water, its appearance resembled that of an Asterias.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This dome-shaped trunk is now known

<p>"The Lepidodendra (Scaly-trees) are a tribe of plants whose remains abound in the Coal
formation, and rival in number and magnitude the Calamites and Sigillariæ previously described.
The name is derived from the imbricated or scaly appearance of the surface, occasioned by the
little angular scars left by the separation of the leaves. Some of these trees have been found
almost entire, from their roots to the topmost branches. One specimen, forty feet high, and
thirteen feet in diameter at the base, and divided towards the summit into fifteen or twenty
branches, was discovered in the Jarrow coal-mine, near Newcastle.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>"The foliage of these trees consists of simple linear leaves, spirally arranged around the stem,
and which appear to have been shed from the base of the tree with age. The markings produced
by the attachment of the leaves are never obliterated, and the twigs and branches are generally
found covered with foliage. The originals are supposed by M. Adolphe Brongniart, notwithstanding
their gigantic size, to have been closely related to the Lycopodia, or Club-mosses."<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Associated with the stems of Lepidodendra, and oftentimes imbedded in masses of their
foliage, and in some instances attached to the extremities of the branches, are numerous oblong
or cylindrical scaly cones, garnished with leaves: an imperfect specimen is figured in <a href="#Plate_9">Plate IX.</a>

in this fossil plant are very fine, arched, and rise obliquely from the base of the leaflet.</p>

are so firm, and so slightly attached to the shale, that they may be separated by a pair of
forceps: when removed, their impression remains on the stone, as is shown in the light-coloured

and undulated; the leaflets are sessile, linear-lanceolate; the ribs pinnate, the secondary ribs
perpendicular to the main rib; the first leaflet on the superior side of the pinnule adheres by its
side to the rachis."&mdash;<i>Artis.</i></p>

<p>This fern, which closely resembles some recent species, (<i>Pteris aurita</i>,) occurs in great
abundance in the shale at Alverthorpe near Wakefield. Notwithstanding the profusion with
which the foliage of many kinds of ferns is distributed throughout the coal formation, the
undoubted stems of tree-ferns are so rare, that it may admit of question whether some of the
leaves which from the analogy of their structure to recent forms have been referred to the ferns,
may not have belonged to the stems of unknown trees with which they are associated in the
strata; for as, in the animal kingdom, distinct types of living organisms are often found blended
in the extinct races, so in the vegetable, it is possible, that foliage and stems, of apparently
discordant types, may have belonged to the same extinct species or genus of trees. This
problem can only be solved by diligent and continued research in the richest localities of
coal-plants.</p>

<p>M. Brongniart remarks that every bed of coal is the product of a special vegetation, often
different from that which preceded, and that which followed it. Each bed thus resulting from a
distinct vegetation, is characterized by the predominance of certain impressions of plants, and the
experienced miners distinguish in many cases the beds they are working, by their practical
knowledge of the plants that prevail.</p>

<p>The same beds of coal, and the deposits which cover it, ought therefore to contain the
different parts of the plants that were living at the period of its formation; and by carefully
studying the association of these different fossils, forming thus little special floras, generally of
but few species, we may hope to acquire data by which we may advance the means of reconstructing
the anomalous vegetable forms of the ancient world. M. Brongniart strongly urges
attention to this circumstance in the examination of the coal strata, with the view of determining
the identity of the scattered leaves, stems, and fruits, in any particular stratum. By such a
procedure, much addition would be made to our knowledge of the entire structures of many of
the fossil plants of which we now only know the fragments. Thus we may hope to ascertain the
foliage of the Sigillariæ, the roots of which, by a similar method, have but recently been
determined to be the fossils called <i>Stigmariæ</i>.</p>

<div class="tdc">
<div class="spl">(<i>Syringopora geniculata</i>, of Phillips, from the Mountain Limestone, Derbyshire.)</div>
</div>

<p>The specimen figured is a mass of limestone, on the surface of which is spread out in high
relief a delicate tubiporite, or fossil coral, allied to the Tubipora, or "Organ-pipe coral," so
generally preserved in cabinets of natural curiosities, from the beauty and elegance of its
crimson tubes. The fossil, however, though somewhat resembling the recent coral in its general
form, belongs to an extinct genus.</p>

<p>This Syringopora appears to have been very abundant in the sea in which the strata of
mountain or carboniferous limestone were deposited, for it forms entire beds of great extent.
A beautifully figured marble results from this coral, when the interstices of its tubes have been
filled up with compact calcareous matter. A small polished slab is represented in fig. 2. At
Matlock, vases, and other ornamental articles, are made of it; and the sections of the coral
tubes impart considerable variety of figures.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> Articles of this kind may be obtained of Mr. Tennant, 149, Strand.</p></div>

<p>Some slabs of this fossil coral are of a dull red hue, which there is every reason to conclude
is due to the colour of the original; and not only are traces of the natural tints of the living
zoophyte preserved, but even the animal membrane of the coral; and this may be exposed by
immersing a fragment of the marble in dilute muriatic (hydrochloric) acid. Mr. Parkinson thus
describes the result of his first experiment:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A fragment of the marble (<a href="#Plate_34">Plate XXXIV.</a> fig. 2) was exposed to the action of muriatic
acid in a very dilute state. As the calcareous earth was dissolved, and the carbonic acid escaped,
I was delighted to observe the membranaceous substance appear, depending from the stone in
light, flocculent, elastic flakes. Many of these retained a deep red colour, and appeared in
a beautiful and distinct manner, although not absolutely retaining the form of the tubipore.
A faithful representation of this appearance is given in fig. 3."</p>

<p>This experiment of Mr. Parkinson was highly important, as proving the previously almost
incredible fact, that animal membrane, when hermetically sealed, as it were, in the solid stone,
was as indestructible as the rock itself. It suggested, too, the probability that vestiges of other
animal tissues might be traced in organic remains, and encouraged subsequent observers to seek
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[ 88 ]</a></span>
for evidence of the soft parts of animal bodies entombed in the strata. It was the first step in the
right direction, and led to the detection of many highly interesting phenomena. In Dr. Buckland's
Bridgewater Essay will be found figures and descriptions of the eyes of crustacea: of the
wings, elytra or wing-covers, and the integuments of the body of insects; of the skin of reptiles;
and, in the "Wonders of Geology," and "Medals of Creation," of the membranes of the air-bladder,
and of the capsule of the eye of fishes; of the soft parts of the animalcules called
foraminifera, &amp;c. The bodies of mollusca, or shell-fish, converted into a dark brown mass (<i>mollushite</i>),
occur in such abundance in some deposits, as to yield a rich manure from the quantity of
phosphate of lime. The excrementitious substances termed by Dr. Buckland "Coprolites," are
also used for agricultural purposes.</p>

transverse sections of the parallel tubes, which being of an oval form, and in close
apposition, give rise to chain-like figures, as shown in figs. 5 and 6. From Dudley.</p></div>

<p>This fossil coral abounds in that division of the Silurian formation termed the Wenlock or
Dudley limestones, wherever these deposits occur. The most exquisite specimens are obtained
from the Falls of the Ohio, at Louisville, in the United States of America. A coral reef of the
Silurian epoch here exists in the bed of the mighty stream of fresh water, almost as perfect as
when growing in its native sea! The river dashes over the entire mass in the season of high
water; but in those periods when the stream is low, the ridge of coral is exposed, and its surface
then presents the most extraordinary display of Silurian corals, of numerous species and genera,
standing in relief on the more compact masses of the rock. The substance of the corals, being
siliceous, resists the action of the cataract, while the softer calcareous matter which filled up the
interstices of the tubes, lamellæ, &amp;c. of the zoophytes, is washed away atom by atom; and natural
dissections are formed, which art would in vain attempt to imitate. Dr. Yandell, of the Medical
College, Louisville, and Dr. Clapp, of New Albany, have splendid collections from the Falls,
which every geologist and intelligent traveller who visits Kentucky should not fail to examine:
the masses of Astreæ, Madrepores, &amp;c. are so fresh in their aspect, as not to be readily distinguished
from the recent specimens of the same genera which are placed beside them.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span> The shells of Oysters, and other mollusca, are subjected to the ravages of a parasitical
sponge, (<i>Cliona</i>, of Dr. Grant,) which is beset with minute siliceous spines or spicula,
and inhabits hollows formed in the substance of the shell. Shells thus honeycombed,
as it were, may often be found on the sea-shore with the excavated parts filled up by
sponge. I have shells collected by my eldest son on the shores of New Zealand, that
are hollowed out in a similar manner, and occupied by sponge. Whether these cavities
are produced by mechanical means, or are the result of the decay and absorption of the
shell induced by the growth of the parasite, are questions still undetermined. There
are several kinds of shells found fossil, which were infested with a similar parasitical
sponge; and when the cavities thus produced have been filled up by flint, and the
shell has subsequently decomposed, or been worn away, the surface of the flint is
studded with the casts of the cells, in the form of small irregular globular bodies,
connected by filaments or strings of flint. The fossil, fig. 1, is a fossil of this kind,
described by Mr. Parkinson as being "covered with minute round bodies, the nature
of which is unknown;" fig. 12, is an enlarged view of five of these globular casts
connected by filaments.</p></div>

<p>This beautiful plate of a petrified zoophyte allied to the Spongia, formed the frontispiece
to Mr. Parkinson's second volume. The fossil delineated is from Touraine in France, and
is one of the most perfect examples of this kind hitherto observed. It belongs to a group
of cup-shaped <i>Amorphozoa</i>, (as these organisms are now named by naturalists, from the great
irregularity of shape which they assume,) termed <i>Chenendopora</i>. The original organic substance
is transmuted into silex, and the interstices are filled up with carbonate of lime. The same
species occurs in the greensand in the Vale of Pewsey in Wiltshire, and, I believe, also in the
white-chalk; for many cyathiform flints from the South Downs appear to have the same
internal structure.</p>

<p>In the so-called "gravel-pits," near Faringdon, in Berkshire,&mdash;which are quarries of a loosely-aggregated
grit of the greensand, almost wholly made up of the relics of shells, corals, amorphozoa,
&amp;c.&mdash;numerous sponges of this genus are met with. One beautiful species (<i>Chenendopora
fungiformis</i>) has acquired, from its cup-like form, the local name of "petrified salt-cellar."<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span> A flint from the gravel-pits at Hackney. Its form is derived from the enclosed
zoophyte, part of whose structure is exposed in the upper portion of the figure.
This fossil zoophyte (<i>Choanites K&ouml;nigi</i>, of Mantell) is very abundant in some of the
chalk strata, and many of the most beautifully marked pebbles cut and polished for
brooches by the lapidaries of Brighton, Bognor, and the Isle of Wight, are the
silicified soft parts of this animal. The original was of a subglobular form, and
probably of a soft fleshy consistence; it had a deep central cavity, whence numerous
tubes diverged, and ramified throughout the mass; it was fixed at the base by radicle
or root-like processes.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_32" id="Footnote_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> See Medals of Creation, p. 264. "Thoughts on a Pebble," (eighth edition,) contains coloured figures and a full
description of these fossils.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span> This is another characteristic and abundant fossil zoophyte of the chalk and flint.
The specimen figured is a water-worn pebble, and therefore gives but obscure
indications of the form and structure of the original. The fungiform flints&mdash;called
in Sussex petrified mushrooms&mdash;belong to the same genus (<i>Ventriculites</i>, of Mantell):
and highly interesting specimens occur in which some part of the zoophyte
is invested with flint, and the other part expanded in the chalk. The original was
probably a polyparium&mdash;that is, the skeleton or support of an aggregation of coral-polypes&mdash;of
a funnel shape, the polype-shells being situated on the inner surface:
the base was attached by root-like fibres.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The polype-cells are cylindrical and
regular, and clusters of beautiful casts of them often occur on flints.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span> This specimen is described by Mr. Parkinson as "a pear-shaped alcyonite from
Switzerland." It is probably one of those fossil zoophytes allied to the sponges
(called <i>Siphonia</i>), in which the upper part is of a bulbous or pear-like form, and
is supported by a stem with root-like processes at the base. The bulb has a central
cavity studded with irregular pores, that communicates with the parallel longitudinal
tubes of which the stem is composed: a structure admitting of that ready ingress
and egress of the sea-water, which this class of organisms requires. There are
numerous species in the greensand of the chalk formation.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p></div>

<p>The Lily-shaped animals (<i>Crinoidea</i>), so named from a fancied resemblance of some species
when in a state of repose to a closed lily, may be compared to a Feather-star (<i>Comatula</i>) fixed to
a jointed column, with its mouth upwards; the base of the stem being attached to the rock by
root-like processes. The only known living genus inhabits the seas of the West Indies, and the
specimen figured represents the body (or upper part of the animal), with a considerable portion
of the stem remaining attached. The Crinoidea are divided into two groups; Encrinites, having
the ossicula (little bones) of the stem rounded, and Pentacrinites, in which the ossicula of the
column are pentagonal, or angular. The Crinoidea are characterized by having a fixed base,
a column or stem composed of numerous separate articulated pieces of a solid calcareous substance,
supporting on its summit a vase, or receptacle, formed by a series of closely adjusted
plates, which contain the body, or viscera. The upper part of the receptacle is covered by
a plated integument, on one side of which an aperture or mouth is placed. From the upper
margin proceed five articulated tentacula or arms, which subdivide into branches that in some
species are very numerous and of extreme tenuity. On the inside, the arms are beset with
articulated cirri or feelers. The joints composing the column are perforated by a central opening;
there are also side-arms, that radiate from the column in groups of five at different points.
When the animal is alive, the skeleton is covered by a soft integument, as in the star-fishes, and
the arms spread out and expand, forming a net, by which living prey is captured and conveyed
to the mouth by the tentacula, in the same manner as in the fresh-water polype or Hydra.</p>

<p>The fossil remains of Crinoidea consist of the ossicula of the column, arms, and tentacula;
of the plates of the vase, or receptacle; and of the peduncle, or base of attachment. This
family of Radiaria, though now of such excessive rarity, swarmed in the seas that deposited the
ancient secondary strata; whole mountain chains and extensive tracts of country are composed
of strata almost entirely made up of their fossil remains.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The number and species of genera is

Star-fishes; like the former, the receptacle is composed of articulated plates, closed
at the top by a tessellated plate-work with a buccal aperture, and surrounded by
five flexible arms; but the original animal, like the Star-fishes, was destitute of a

<p>This exquisite species of the extinct Crinoideans which swarmed in the seas of the secondary
ages of Geology, is equally interesting and attractive to the amateur collector and the scientific
observer. The specimen figured is a charming example of the "<i>Stone Lily</i>" partly expanded,
attached to a block of limestone studded with encrinal ossicula. Mr. Parkinson informed me
that it was formerly in the collection of Mr. Jacob Forster, and cost him twenty guineas;
from five to ten guineas is now the usual price for a specimen in a good state of preservation,
with any part of the column attached. This Encrinite is not known to occur in England. The
specimens seen in collections are for the most part from Lower Saxony: this species has only
been found in the limestone strata called "<i>Muschelkalk</i>" one of the subdivisions of the <i>Trias</i>,
or New Red Sandstone formation, of Germany.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The most celebrated locality of these fossils
is in Brunswick, near the village of Erkerode, about two miles from the town bearing the
same name. The bed in which they are found is a soft argillaceous cream-coloured limestone,
about one foot and a half in thickness; and the stone is composed chiefly of trochites, or detached
ossicula of the stems, and a few fragile shells and corals.</p>

<p>An elaborate account of the structure of the skeleton of the Lily Encrinite is given by
Mr. Miller, in his valuable work, "The Natural History of the Lily-shaped Animals," (1 vol.
4to. 1821.) Mr. Parkinson had previously carefully investigated the different parts which
enter into the composition of the receptacle and column, and had given them names analogous
to those employed to designate the bones of the skeleton in vertebrated animals. This nomenclature
has very properly been abandoned; but I subjoin Mr. Parkinson's description of the

<p>The most generally known of the British Crinoidea, from its size, and abundance in one
particular locality, is the "<i>Pear Encrinite</i>" of Bradford in Wiltshire, some of the quarries
of the oolite on the heights above that picturesquely-situated town, yielding not only immense
quantities of detached plates and ossicula, but also numerous examples of the receptacle,
and occasionally the entire skeleton from the peduncle of the base to the extremities of the arms.
The lamented Mr. Channing Pearce, and his father (now of Percy Place, Grosvenor, Bath),
when resident at Bradford, paid such unremitting attention to the collection of these fossils,
that perfect specimens were obtained, exhibiting the entire structure of the originals; of these
some fine examples are preserved in the British Museum. Sir Charles Lyell mentions a very
interesting fact relating to the occurrence of these Crinoidea in the strata. He states that the
upper surface of a bed of limestone at Bradford is incrusted with a continuous pavement
formed by the stony roots of the Apiocrinites; and upon this is a layer of clay in which are the
stems and bodies (receptacles) of innumerable examples; some erect, others lying prostrate;
while throughout the clay are scattered detached arms, stems, and receptacles. This submarine
forest of Crinoideans must therefore have flourished in the clear sea-water till invaded by
a current loaded with mud, which overwhelmed the living zoophytes, and entombed them
in the argillaceous deposit in which their remains are now imbedded.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The receptacle of this Apiocrinite is pyriform and very smooth, the plates are large and thin,
with radiating articulated surfaces; the stem is short, smooth, and strong, the arms are simple,
and like those of the Marsupite; the peduncle spreads out into an expanded base, which is firmly
attached to the rock; sections of this part are generally of a purple colour.</p>

the buccal aperture or mouth is situated at the side. The stem of this group is
thickly beset with side-arms. (Fig. 7 is a very small detached one.) The arms are
numerous (amounting to thirty in the species figured), and of great length; these
subdivide into jointed filaments of extreme minuteness. Slabs of limestone are often
entirely covered with them, and many layers are wholly made up of their aggregated
remains. The plates of the receptacle are generally highly ornamented: in one
species the sculpturing so closely resembles that of the <i>Marsupites ornatus</i> of the
chalk, that it was with difficulty I convinced Mr. Parkinson that the latter did not

<p>The radiated animals popularly called Star-fishes, from their stellular figure, are so
abundant along our sea shores, that the nature of the common five-rayed species (<i>Asterias</i>, or
<i>Uraster rubens</i>)<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> must be familiar to most of my readers. This species belongs to the group in
which the rays are elongated, and far exceed in length the diameter of the disk; in another subdivision
(the <i>Goniaster</i>, or Cushion-star), the body is angular, and the lobes or rays are short, and
do not exceed in length the diameter of the body. In another group (the <i>Comatula</i>, or Feather-star),
the rays are fringed with long jointed tentacula, which divide and subdivide like those of
the Crinoidea; and these star-fishes may, in fact, be regarded as free Lily-shaped animals.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
There is another tribe in which the arms are elongated into slender rays, without grooves or
tentacula; these are called the Serpent Star-fishes (<i>Ophiura</i>). Species of all these groups occur
in a fossil state.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

of Parkinson; <i>Goniaster Parkinsoni</i>, of Prof. E. Forbes). Remains of Star-fishes
are by no means rare in the chalk strata of Kent; in those of Sussex they are
far less common. When the "Fossils of the South Downs" was published, in 1822,
a few fragments only had been discovered. Of late years, some beautiful examples
have been obtained from the chalk-pits near Arundel and Worthing, by Mr. Dixon,
Mr. Coombe, Mrs. Smith, of Tunbridge Wells, and other collectors. The cabinet
of the Marquess of Northampton is very rich in this class of fossils. Several unique
examples of new species have been obtained from the chalk near Maidstone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span> "An echinite, from France."&mdash;<i>Mr. Parkinson.</i> The locality of this fossil is uncertain;
no similar specimen is known either to Mr. Morris, or the other eminent palæontologists
I have consulted; and the original cannot be discovered. I have reason to
believe it was purchased, after Mr. Parkinson's death, together with the greater
number of the fossils already described, by an American gentleman, and taken to the
United States.</p>

of the Marquess of Northampton contains a perfect and exquisite specimen
attached to a flint, from that locality.</p>

<p>The <i>Cidaris</i>, or Turban Echinite, belongs to the family of radiated animals, of which the
recent Sea-urchin (<i>Echinus sphæra</i>) is a well-known example. The globular shell or envelope of
these animals is composed of numerous calcareous polygonal plates, arranged in regular and
elegant patterns, like the lines of the meridian on a globe. These plates are externally covered
with papillæ of various sizes, to which spines of corresponding magnitude are articulated. In
some of the <i>Cidares</i> the principal tubercles are very large, and their spines several inches in length.
The number and variety of the animals of this family that occur in a fossil state are so great, that
a work expressly devoted to the subject would be required to thoroughly investigate the
characters and relations of the known species. An elementary knowledge of this class of fossil
remains may be obtained by reference to "Medals of Creation," chap. xi. p. 240.</p>

This exquisite fossil is now in the cabinet of the Marquess of Northampton. It was
purchased by Mr. Parkinson for the sum of twenty guineas; but this was in the
palmy days of the study of organic remains, before the terms Geology and Palæontology
were invented, and when a choice relic of "a former world" was cheap at
any price, in the opinion of the enthusiastic collector.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span> A fossil shell named Hippurite (<i>Hippurites bioculatus</i>, of D'Orbigny), from the south
of France. This shell belongs to a family termed <i>Rudistes</i>, whose characters
are somewhat problematical,&mdash;some naturalists referring them to the bivalves,
and others to the univalves. The Hippurite is generally of an elongated conical
form, and has internally two obtuse longitudinal ridges; the base is sometimes
partitioned by transverse septa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 5</span>, is a longitudinal section of a specimen in which septa are displayed. The aperture
is closed by a moveable operculum, or upper valve, as in the specimen fig. 1. The
substance of the shell is cellular and very thick, and when fractured, resembles
that of the lamelliferous corals. Some kinds attain a large size, and are called
"petrified horns" by the inhabitants of the districts in the Pyrenees where they
abound. Though Hippurites are abundant in the chalk of the south of France, and
in Spain and Portugal, none have been found in England. The <i>Spherulite</i>, a
nearly allied genus, which has no internal longitudinal ridges, occurs in the chalk
of Sussex: it was first discovered near Lewes. (<i>Spherulites Mortoni</i>, of Mantell.)<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p></div>

<p>In the "<a href="#SupNote_2"><i>Supplementary Notes</i></a>" I have, under the head, "<i>Belemnites</i>," explained somewhat
fully the nature of those fossils which, by the name of "thunderbolts," have for so many
centuries excited the interest and perplexed the ingenuity of collectors of fossil remains.
Referring the reader to that note, I shall therefore in this place merely give such specific
names of the specimens figured by Mr. Parkinson as I have been able to determine.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span> "A Belemnite of large size," Mr. Parkinson. This specimen is part of the phragmocone
from near the lower apical portion, partially invested with the fibrous rostrum
or guard. It is the species named <i>Belemnites giganteus</i> by M. D'Orbigny; from
the Oxford clay of Wiltshire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span> The distal or apical part of the rostrum or guard of a Belemnite. The annexed
outline of a transverse section exhibits the radiated structure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span> The distal part of the guard of a chalk Belemnite (<i>Belemnitella mucronata</i>); from
Norwich. Siliceous casts of the phragmocone of <i>Belemnitella</i> are occasionally met
with in the flints of the South Downs. This phragmocone has a longitudinal flat
band or ridge, extending down the dorsal aspect: the chambers are very numerous;
the slit or fissure in the ventral aspect of the guard, is occupied by a thin expansion
of the phragmocone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span> A Belemnite from the great oolite of Stonesfield (<i>Belemnites fusiformis</i>, of Parkinson).
The upper part shows the alveolus for the reception of the apex of the phragmocone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span> Cast of part of a straight-chambered shell (<i>Baculites Fraujasii</i>, of Lamarck), in which the
septa, or partitions, are deeply and regularly sinuated. In fossils of this kind, the
cast of each chamber is distinct from the others; but the series is held together by
the flexuosities of the septa. From Maestricht.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span> A limestone cast of the chamber of an Ammonite: from Bath. The elongated channel

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span> Fragment of an Ammonite, showing cavities of two chambers, and the canal of the
siphuncle, partly lined with calcareous spar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span> Polished sections of an Ammonite (<i>Ammonites Walcotii</i>) from the Lias, Whitby. The
chambers are filled with semi-transparent spar. The siphunculus is seen running
along the dorsal, or outer margins of the volutions. The dark appearances observable
in several parts of the siphuncle result from the carbonization of the animal membrane
with which the tube was lined in the living state.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span> "An <i>Oval Ammonite</i>."&mdash;<i>Mr. Parkinson.</i> This is evidently the cast of a discoidal shell
pressed into an elliptical form. In the Chalk-marl, casts of Ammonites, Nautilites,
&amp;c. are very commonly more or less distorted by compression. The marl appears to
have remained in a plastic state after the decomposition of the shell in which it was
moulded, and to have admitted of being squeezed into close contact with the
surrounding matrix; when the stratum became consolidated the cast retained its
accidental shape, and adhering but slightly to the investing marl, was separable by a
properly directed blow. This explains the otherwise unintelligible fact of a cast
being closely invested by the rock, and all traces of the shell in which it was formed
absent. When both the cast and the matrix became solid and uncompressible before
the shell was decomposed, then loose casts were formed; as is common in the Portland
stone, &amp;c. The fossil figured appears to be an indifferent example of a common
chalk-marl species (<i>Ammonites Mantelli</i>, of Sowerby).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span> Cast of a spiral chambered shell, called <i>Turrilite</i>, of which many species occur in the
lower cretaceous strata (<i>Turrilites costatus</i>, of Langius). The quarries of lower chalk
at St. Catharine's Mount, near Rouen, in Normandy, have long been celebrated for
the number and perfection of specimens of this elegant type of cephalopodous shells.
The first known English examples of this genus, as well as of Scaphites, were
discovered by me in the chalk marl, at Hamsey, near Lewes, in Sussex, in 1810.
Several very fine specimens of a large species (<i>Turrilites tuberculatus</i>), some of which
are more than two feet in length, have been obtained from the same strata. The
tubercles on the casts of this species are the bases of strong spines. The siphunculus,

<p><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 13 to 27. These figures all refer to a very curious group of fossils, termed <i>Nummulites</i>,

a beautiful and masterly memoir in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society

"<i>Moss-corals</i>." As the family to which they belong comprises a numerous assemblage
of minute organic remains, many of which are delineated in the next plate (Plate

Though found in pairs, there is no hinge or natural connexion. Some naturalists
suppose they may belong to the internal organization of Ammonites, because certain
kinds have been found collocated with particular species of that genus of Cepholopoda.
At present I do not think there is any satisfactory evidence as to their
real nature. Species occur in the Kimmeridge clay, and other subdivisions of the

are distinguished by the deep concave under-valve, and its curved beak, and the
almost flat upper shell. The testaceous substance is of a finer laminated structure

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span> The fossil is the cast of an oyster-like bivalve, called Perna, (<i>Perna quadrata</i>, of
Sowerby,) which is easily recognisable, even in casts, by the line of distinct teeth
which compose the hinge. This species is abundant in the Portland limestone,
particularly in the quarries around Swindon, in Wiltshire; but from the close
adhesion of the outer surface of the shell to the surrounding stone, they can seldom
be extracted, the casts only being readily obtainable. In the Kimmeridge clay, which
lies above the Portland rock, the shells may be met with in great perfection. The
best locality is near Hartwell, in Buckinghamshire, where the clay is extensively dug
for the brick manufactures.</p>

These organs are supported by shelly processes, curiously modified in different genera,
which often occur in a fossil state. Although the fossil Terebratulæ are very numerous,
the recent species are but few, and are inhabitants of the seas off Australia. They form
two natural groups; in the one the shells are smooth, but perforated all over with
minute openings or foramina; and these are often filled with a dark substance, which
is the carbonized soft parts: in the other division the shells are plicated or furrowed,
and are not foraminiferous.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The Spirifers, another group of Brachiopoda, have a pair

<p class="caption4nb"><span class="smcap">Tooth of the Mastodon.</span></p>

<p>A <span class="smcap">molar</span> tooth of the <i>Mastodon giganteus</i>, from Big-bone Lick, Kentucky; of the natural size.</p>

<p>From the great number of bones and teeth of animals of the extinct elephantine genus,
to which the name of Mastodon was given by Cuvier (from the structure of the crowns of the
teeth), that have of late years been brought to England, and are dispersed in our public and
private collections, the intelligent reader must be familiar with the forms, characters, and gigantic
proportions, of that stupendous tribe of animals which once ranged through the primeval forests
not only of America, but also of some parts of Europe. From a perfect skeleton lately set
up in the British Museum (in the same room with that of the Megatherium), a correct idea may
be obtained of this peculiar type of mammalian structure. From this specimen it appears
that the great Mastodon of the Ohio was not unlike the elephant In its general outline, though
somewhat longer and thicker. It had a trunk or proboscis, tusks which curved upward, and
four molar teeth in each jaw, but no incisors. But another remarkable peculiarity, and which
entirely separates the Mastodon from the Elephant, is that the young animal had a pair of tusks,
placed horizontally in the lower jaw, and of these tusks one only became developed, and that
in the adult male: both were early shed in the female. In the midst of a collection of Mastodon
bones imbedded in mud, a mass of small branches, grass, and leaves, in a half bruised state,
and a species of reed common in Virginia, were discovered; the whole appeared to have been
enveloped in a sac, probably the stomach of the animal. In another instance traces of the
proboscis were observed. The tusks are composed of ivory, and vary somewhat in the direction
and degree of their curvature. The bones of this colossal quadruped are found remarkably fresh
and well preserved, and are generally impregnated with iron. No living instance of this
creature is on record, and there can be no doubt that its race has long since been extinct.</p>

<p>"Big-bone Lick, where so many remains of the Mastodon and other extinct quadrupeds
have been dug up, is distant from Cincinnati about twenty-three miles in a south-west direction.
This celebrated bog is situated in a nearly level plain, in a valley bounded by gentle slopes,
which lead up to flat table-lands composed of blue argillaceous (Silurian) limestone, and marl.
The general course of the meandering stream which flows through the plain, is from east to
west. There are two springs on the southern or left bank, rising from marshes, and two on the
opposite bank; the most western of which, called the Gum Lick, is at the point where a small
tributary joins the principal stream. The quaking bogs on this side are now more than fifteen
acres in extent; but all the marshes were formerly larger, before the surrounding forest was
partially cleared away. Within the memory of persons now living, the wild bisons or buffaloes
crowded to these springs; but they have retreated many years, and are now as unknown to the
inhabitants as the Mastodon itself. The bog in the spots where the salt springs rise is so soft,
that a pole may be forced down into it many yards perpendicularly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[ 168 ]</a></span></p>

<p>"The greater numbers both of the entire skeletons and the separate bones have been taken
up from black mud, about twelve feet below the level of the Creek. It is supposed that the
bones of the mastodons found here could not have belonged to less than one hundred individuals:
those of the fossil Elephant (<i>Elephas primigenius</i>) to twenty; besides which a few bones of the
Megalonyx, and of a species of stag, horse, and bison, are stated to have been collected. The
greatest depth of the black mud has not been ascertained; it is composed chiefly of clay, with
a mixture of calcareous matter and sand, and contains 5 parts in 100 of sulphate of lime, with
some animal matter. Layers of gravel occur in the midst of it at various depths. It contains
remains of seeds, and of several species and genera of fresh-water and terrestrial shells. It
is impossible to view this plain without at once concluding that it has remained unchanged
in all its principal features, from the period when the extinct quadrupeds inhabited the banks
of the Ohio and its tributaries.</p>

<p>"There are two buffalo paths or trails still extant in the woods, and both lead directly
to springs: the one which strikes off in a northerly direction from the Gum Lick, may be traced
eastward through the forest for several miles. It is three or four yards wide, and only partially
overgrown with grass, and sixty years ago was as bare, hard, and well trodden, as a high road.
It is well known that during great droughts in the Pampas of South America, the horses, deer,
and cattle, throng to the rivers in such numbers, that the foremost of the crowd are pushed into
the stream by the pressure of others behind, and are sometimes carried away by thousands,

Germany have been celebrated for their osseous treasures, particularly those in Franconia. The
most remarkable of these caverns is that of Gaylenreuth, which lies to the north-west of the village
of that name, on the left bank of the river Wiesent, on the confines of Bayreuth.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The entrance
to this cave is in the face of a perpendicular rock, and leads to a series of chambers from fifteen
to twenty feet high, and several hundred feet in extent, terminating in a deep chasm. The cave
is quite dark; and the icicles and pillars of stalactite, reflected by the light of the torches, which
it is necessary to use, present a highly picturesque effect. The floor is literally paved with bones
and fossil teeth, and the pillars and corbels of stalactite also contain similar remains. The bones
are generally scattered and broken, but not rolled; they are lighter and less solid than recent
bones, and are often incrusted with stalactites. Three-fourths of the bones belong to two
species of bears (<i>Ursus</i>), the remainder to hyænas, tigers, wolves, foxes, gluttons, weasels, and
other small carnivora. Those belonging to bears are referable to two extinct species: the
largest has the skull more prominent on the front than any living species; it is named <i>Ursus
spelæus</i>, or cavern bear; the other has a flat forehead, and is the <i>Ursus priscus</i> of Cuvier. The
Hyena was allied to the spotted hyena of the Cape, but differed in the form of the teeth and
skull. Bones of the Elephant and Rhinoceros are said to have been discovered, together with
those of existing animals, and fragments of sepulchral urns of high antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

Kent's Hole, near Torquay, and Banwell Cave, in the Mendip Hills, near the village of

in the secondary deposits, there are perhaps no fossil bodies that have excited so much curiosity, or
given rise to so many fanciful conjectures as to their nature and origin, as the long, cylindrical,
fusiform, crystalline stones, called <i>Belemnites</i> by naturalists, and <i>thunderbolts</i> by common
observers. Mr. Parkinson gives an amusing account (vol. iii. p. 122) of the discordant opinions
entertained at various times respecting the nature of these bodies.</p>

<p>It would be irrelevant to dwell on the history of the successive attempts that have been
made to elucidate the origin and structure of the Belemnite. It will suffice to describe concisely
the present state of our knowledge as to the organization of the original.</p>

<p>Mr. Miller, in 1823,<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> showed that the Belemnite was the rostrum or osselet of an animal
allied to the Sepia, or Cuttle-fish, and gave a restored outline of the supposed form of the
original, with the Belemnite in its presumed natural situation. Dr. Buckland and M. Agassiz
imagined that they had traced a natural connexion between certain species of Belemnites that
abound in the Lias, and the ink bag and other soft parts of the Sepiæ or Calamaries found
associated with them; and they suggested the name of <i>Belemno-sepia</i> for the supposed animal of
the Belemnite,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>In 1842, the late Mr. Channing Pearce described, under the name of <i>Belemnoteuthis antiquus</i>,
a naked (destitute of a shell,) cephalopod, which occurs in immense numbers in certain beds
of the Oxford clay, especially at Christian Malford, in Wiltshire. This animal has at the
lower apical part a conical osselet of a horny substance, and fibrous structure, enclosing a
chambered siphunculated shell, which becomes gradually thinner at the upper part, and forms
a cup-like receptacle, in which is placed the ink-bag. The soft body of an elongated oval form,
with a pair of lateral palleal fins, two large sessile eyes, and with eight uncinated arms and
a pair of long tentacula, are preserved in a more or less distinct and perfect state in several
specimens that have lately been discovered. Mr. Channing Pearce, Mr. Cunnington, and other
collectors of these interesting remains, were convinced that this cephalopod was entirely distinct
from the animal to which the Belemnite belonged.</p>

<p>In 1844, Professor Owen laid before the Royal Society "A description of certain Belemnites
preserved with a great proportion of their soft parts in the Oxford clay, at Christian Malford,
Wilts."<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> In this memoir (for which one of the royal medals of the Society was awarded) the
author describes as the soft parts of the Belemnite the remains of the animal which Mr. Channing
Pearce had two years previously shown to belong to a different genus (<i>Belemnoteuthis</i>). Belying
on the correctness of Professor Owen's views, I gave an abstract of this memoir in my "<i>Medals
of Creation</i>," and stated that belemnites had been discovered with the osselet, receptacle, and ink-bag,
in their natural position, and with remains of the mantle, body, fins, eyes, and the tentacula,
with their horny rings and hooks.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The discovery by my son (Mr. Reginald Neville Mantell) of some remarkably perfect specimens
of belemnites in the Oxford clay, exposed in the railway works on which he was engaged, near
Trowbridge, in Wilts, led me to examine the structure of the Belemnoteuthis with more
attention than I had hitherto done, as well as the evidence adduced by Professor Owen in proof
that the fossil osselet, the Belemnite, belonged to the same genus of cephalopoda. I found that <i>no
specimen had been obtained in which the phragmocone, or terminal chambered part of the Belemnoteuthis</i>
(of Pearce), <i>was situated in the alveolus of a Belemnite</i>; but Professor Owen having assumed that the
osselet of the former must have originally been protected by a rostrum, or guard, described
the soft parts as belonging to the animal of the Belemnite, conceiving that the phragmocone
of the Belemnoteuthis was that of a Belemnite that had slipped out of the guard.</p>

<p>In a communication to the Royal Society, in 1848, I demonstrated how utterly at variance
with the facts were these conclusions, and pointed out the essential distinctive characters that
separated the two extinct genera, so far as the specimens then discovered would warrant.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Other
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[ 171 ]</a></span>
illustrative examples of the Belemnite have since been obtained; and
in a supplementary paper read before the Royal Society, February 14th,
of the present year (1850), I have stated what appears to me to be the
extent of our present knowledge of the organization of the Belemnite.
I subjoin an abstract of that paper, which embodies the result of an
examination of many hundred specimens of Belemnites and Belemnoteuthites.
The annexed outline, or diagram, shows the known structures
of the Belemnite; of the soft parts of the animal, a few imperfect carbonaceous
traces, apparently of the mantle, around and between the
shelly processes of the upper part of the phragmocone, are the only
vestiges I have been able to detect. The most perfect Belemnite hitherto
discovered consists of,</p>

<p>1. An external <i>Capsule</i> (<i>e</i>) which invested the osselet or sepiostaire,
and extending upwards, constituted the external sheath of the receptacle.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Osselet</i>, characterized by its fibrous radiated structure, terminating
distally in a solid rostrum or guard (<i>i</i>), having an alveolus, or
conical hollow (<i>g</i>), to receive the apical portion of the chambered
phragmocone, and expanding proximally into a thin cup, which became
confluent with the capsule, and formed the receptacle (<i>b, b</i>,) for the
viscera.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Phragmocone</i> (<i>d</i>), or chambered, siphunculated (<i>c</i>), internal
shell; the apex of which occupied the alveolus (<i>g</i>) of the guard, and
the upper part constituted a capacious chamber, from the basilar margin
of which proceeded two long, flat, testaceous, processes (<i>a, a</i>,).</p>

<p>These structures comprise all that are at present known of the
animal to which the fossil commonly called "<i>Belemnite</i>," belonged.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Belemnoteuthis</i>, the cephalopod which Professor Owen
considers to be a Belemnite, many examples of the body with eight
uncinated arms and a pair of long tentacula, and with an ink-bag, and
palleal fins, have been discovered. The osselet of this animal, like that
of the Belemnite, has a fibro-radiated structure, investing a conical
chambered shell; but this organ, for reasons fully detailed in the memoir,
could never have been contained within the alveolus of a Belemnite.</p>

<p>No <i>certain</i> evidence has been obtained of the occurrence of an
<i>ink-bag</i> in natural connexion with a Belemnite.</p>

chambers of the phragmocone; the latter is seen extending downwards till it terminates in a point

extends through the entire series of chambers, and is situated on the ventral margin, is indicated
at <i>c, c</i>. The dorsal processes (<i>a, a</i>) are seen on their inner aspect at the upper part; the diverging

<p><a id="SupNote_3">III.</a> <span class="smcap">Fossil Remains of Birds.</span>&mdash;<i>The Moa, or Dinornis of New Zealand.</i> The bones of birds are
of extreme rarity in a fossil state. Throughout the immense series of the palæozoic and secondary
formations&mdash;the accumulated sedimentary deposits of innumerable ages&mdash;no unquestionable indications
of the existence of this class of highly organized beings have been brought to light.</p>

<p>In the Triassic, or New Red argillaceous sandstones of the valley of the Connecticut River,
in North America, some very remarkable phenomena have, however, been discovered, and which
in the opinions of many eminent observers render it highly probable, that at the period when
these strata were deposited, numerous birds, some of colossal magnitude, abounded on the then
dry land. When slabs of these sandstones are split asunder, or exposed, so as to exhibit the
sedimentary surface which separates one layer from another, the foot-prints of many species of
bipeds are perceived deeply impressed on the stone, and disposed in such manner as to prove
that they are the tracks of animals that walked over the surface of the deposit when it was in a
soft or plastic state. The close analogy of these imprints to those of birds' feet, not only in their
general resemblance, but also in the disposition of the tracks, and in the relation of the distance
of the stride, and the depth and shallowness of the impressions, to the size of the respective
feet, tends to corroborate the inference first enunciated by Professor Hitchcock, and subsequently
confirmed by other geologists, that these mysterious markings on the rock, are natural records of the
existence of various tribes of birds during the Triassic period;<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> but unfortunately the only
certain evidence of the correctness of this opinion&mdash;remains of the skeletons&mdash;is wanting; not
a vestige of a vertebrated animal of a higher class than fishes and reptiles has been discovered.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>In the vast fluviatile formation&mdash;the Wealden&mdash;of the south-east of England, which abounds
in the remains of terrestrial plants and reptiles, many fragments of bones of such tenuity as to
indicate that they belonged to animals capable of flight, have from time to time been collected
since my first discovery and announcement, in 1822, of supposed birds' bones in the strata of
Tilgate Forest. Some of these relics were declared by Baron Cuvier, and subsequently by
Professor Owen, to be unquestionably those of birds; probably some species of waders. But
recent observations have rendered it doubtful whether all the specimens of this class from the
Wealden, like those from Stonesfield, are not to be regarded as referable to flying reptiles
(Pterodactyles).<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_89" id="Footnote_89"></a><a href="#FNanchor_89"><span class="label">[89]</span></a> Wonders of Geology, vol. i. p. 438, 440. I still think it probable, however, that bones of birds will be detected
among the Wealden fossils.</p></div>

<p>In the chalk of Kent several bones of a very large flying animal have been obtained from
a quarry at Burham, near Maidstone; some of these are figured and described in Professor
Owen's beautiful work on British Fossil Mammals and Birds, as those of a bird allied to the
Albatross; but the occurrence in the same quarry of jaws with teeth, and other undoubted
remains of a gigantic Pterodactyle,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and the absence in the specimens figured of osteological
characters exclusively ornithic, seem to support the conclusion that these also must be ascribed to
flying reptiles.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_90" id="Footnote_90"></a><a href="#FNanchor_90"><span class="label">[90]</span></a> These fossils are in the splendid museum of J. S. Bowerbank, Esq. of Highbury Grove, Islington.</p>

<p>In the most ancient tertiary strata unquestionable vestiges of birds occur; in the Sub-Himalaya
eocene deposits, they are associated with bones of the extinct elephantine mammalia
of India; in those of the Paris basin with the remains of the Palæotheria, &amp;c. In the miocene
and pliocene formations, the bones and even egg-shells of several species and genera have been
detected. The remains of birds, however, even in comparatively recent deposits, were of such
rare occurrence as to be ranked by the collector of fossils among the most precious of his
acquisitions; but a few years ago, a most extraordinary discovery in our Antipodean colony.
New Zealand, astonished and delighted the palæontologist, by placing before him hundreds
of bones of numerous extinct genera of birds, some of which far exceed in magnitude those of
the most gigantic living species, the Ostrich.</p>

<p>In various localities of the maritime districts of New Zealand, there had been observed
in the beds of rivers and streams, fossil bones of birds of colossal magnitude, belonging to many
species and several genera, associated with similar relics of smaller species. These bones had
attracted the attention of the natives long ere the country was visited by Europeans; and
traditions are rife among the New Zealanders that this race formerly existed in great numbers,
and served as food to their remote ancestors. They also believe that some of the largest species
have been seen alive within the memory of man; and even affirm that individuals still exist
in the unfrequented and inaccessible parts of the interior of the country. They call the bird
<i>Moa</i>, and state that its head and tail were adorned with magnificent plumes of feathers, which
were worn by their ancient chiefs as ornaments of distinction.</p>

<p>Nine years since, a fragment of a thigh-bone of a bird larger than that of the Ostrich was
brought to England by Mr. Rule, and submitted to the examination of Professor Owen, who pronounced
it to belong to a gigantic bird of the <i>Struthious</i> (Ostrich) order. A few years afterwards
several collections of vertebræ, bones of the extremities, &amp;c. were transmitted to England by
Messrs. Williams, Wakefield, Earle, &amp;c., which corroborated that opinion, and proved that there
formerly existed in the islands of New Zealand, colossal birds of a type distinct from any known
in other parts of the world. In 1846 and 1847, my eldest son, Mr. Walter Mantell, who has
resided in New Zealand several years, made an extensive and highly interesting collection of
these fossil remains, which arrived in England in 1848. This series contains <i>skulls</i>, with the
<i>mandibles or beaks</i>, bones of other parts of the skeleton, and <i>portions of the egg-shells</i>, of several
extinct species and genera of birds; presenting remarkable deviations from the previously known
types to which they are most nearly allied.</p>

<p>This valuable accession to our knowledge of the osteology of this extinct race of Ostrich-like
birds&mdash;some individuals of which must have attained a height of from ten to twelve feet&mdash;has
yielded important results as to the form, structure, and economy, of these colossal bipeds, and the
prevailing characters of the terrestrial fauna of New Zealand in very remote periods. The
collection, consisting of above 700 specimens, is now in the British Museum: it was obtained
chiefly from a bed of <i>menaccanite</i> or titaniferous iron-sand, that had evidently been washed down
by torrents from the volcanic region of Mount Egmont; that snow-capped ridge which forms
so striking a feature in the physical geography of the North Island, and is the source of the
fresh-water streams that discharge themselves into the ocean along the western shore. The
tract of sand from which my son dug up these relics, is on the coast near the embouchure
of a small river called Waingongoro, between Wanganui and Waimate. That stream evidently
once flowed into the sea far from its present course, for lines of cliffs extend inland from the
now dry sand-spit, and bear marks of the erosive action of currents.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> A few months since,
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[ 174 ]</a></span>
I received from my son another most interesting collection of fossil bones (comprising above
500 specimens), chiefly obtained from the eastern shores of the Middle Island of New Zealand,
when engaged as Government Commissioner for the settlement of native claims. These were
dug up from a morass of small extent, lying in a little creek or bay at Waikouaiti, some twenty
miles north of Otago. This swamp, which is only visible at low water, is composed of vegetable
fibres (apparently of the <i>Phormium tenax</i>), sand, and animal matter. The bones are of a deep
brown colour, and almost as fresh as if recently taken from a tar-pit. Among the specimens
are crania and mandibles, and bones of enormous size. The most remarkable are <i>the entire
series of phalangeals, and the two tarso-metatarsals</i>, (26 in number,) <i>of the right and left foot of
the same individual bird</i> (<i>Dinornis robustus</i>), which were found standing erect, one a yard in
advance of the other; as if the bird had sunk into the mire, and unable to extricate itself, had
perished on the spot. These bones were carefully exhumed and numbered seriatim, and are the
only instances of the bones of the foot and metatarsus found in natural connexion; they are, consequently,
the first certain examples known of the structure of the feet of the colossal birds of
New Zealand. The foot of the Moa, to which these bones belonged, must have been 16 inches
long, and 18 inches wide; and the height of the bird about ten feet. (<i>See the Frontispiece.</i>)</p>

<p>It would extend this article far beyond the limits assigned to this work, were I to attempt
even a cursory account of all the facts and inferences connected with these discoveries. The
anatomical and physiological characters of many species and genera will be found in the admirable
Memoirs on the <i>Dinornis</i>, <i>Palapteryx</i>, <i>Notornis</i>, &amp;c. by Prof. Owen, in the Transactions of the
Zoological Society.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_92" id="Footnote_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92"><span class="label">[92]</span></a> I regret to state that the egg-shells, and many highly interesting bones, belonging to unknown genera of birds, from
Rangatapu or Waingongoro, in my son's first collection, remain undescribed. My notes and observations on the geological
position of the ossiferous deposits of the North Island of New Zealand, derived from the sketches and letters of Mr. Walter
Mantell, are published in the Geological Journal; those on his collection of fossils from the Middle Island will appear in the
same publication in the course of the present year (1850).</p></div>

<p>From the facts at present known as to the position of the ossiferous deposits of New Zealand,
there is reason to conclude that they bear the same relation to the present state of the country,
as the alluvial loam and clay containing the bones of mammoths, Irish Elks, &amp;c. to that of Great
Britain. I think we may safely infer that at a period geologically recent, but historically
very remote, those islands were densely peopled by tribes of ostrich-like birds of species and
genera which have long since become extinct; that many species existed contemporary with
the Maories or native human inhabitants, and that the last of the family were exterminated,
like the Irish Elk, and the Dodo, by man. If, as the natives affirm, some of the race still exist
in the unfrequented parts of the country, they are probably diminutive species, like the Apteryx
or <i>Kivi-Kivi</i>, which is the only living representative known to naturalists, of this once numerous
tribe of colossal Struthionidæ. The only fossil osseous remains from New Zealand not referable to
birds are bones of two species of Seals, and one femur and a few other bones of a Dog. Associated
with the relics of the Dinornis and other extinct genera, and unquestionably coeval with them,
are crania, mandibles, and other bones, of the living species of Apteryx, Albatross, Penguin,
Notornis, Nestor, Water-hen, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The fragments of egg-shells of Dinornis, from Rangatapu, belong to three distinct types,
each of very large size; my son, to convey an idea of the magnitude of one egg, of which he
dug up a large portion, says, "a gentleman's hat would make a capital egg-cup for it." The
markings on the surface of the shells bear a greater resemblance to those on the eggs of the Rhea
and Cassowary than of the Ostrich.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[ 175 ]</a></span></p>

<p>A remarkable fact mentioned by my son throws some light as to the comparatively recent
extirpation of the Moa. In one spot the natives pointed out some little mounds covered with
herbage, as consisting of heaps of ashes and bones, the refuse of the fires and feasts left by their
remote ancestors. Upon digging into them, a quantity of burnt bones was discovered: these
belonged to Man, Moa, and Dog, and were promiscuously intermingled. These calcined bones
present no traces whatever either of the earthy powder or manaccanite sand which the cells
and pores of the fossil bones invariably contain. If, as the natives affirm, these are the
rejectamenta of the feasts of the aborigines, the practice of cannibalism by the New Zealanders
must have been of very ancient date, and could not have originated, as Professor Owen
supposed, from the want of animal food in consequence of the extirpation of the colossal birds.

<p><a id="SupNote_4">IV.</a> <span class="smcap">Botanical arrangement of Fossil Vegetables.</span>&mdash;Mr. Artis, in the Introduction of
his work, offers some judicious observations as to the proper method in which the study of Fossil
Botany should be pursued. He remarks, "that from the imperfect state in which fossil vegetables
are generally found, the ordinary characters by which recent plants are referred to their congeners,
can scarcely ever be detected in them. The sexual organs on which the systems of
Linnæus and Jussieu are founded, and even the integuments of those organs while in the state
of flowering, have uniformly perished. The external parts of the seed or fruit exist, indeed,
in a fossil state, but they are almost always insulated from the other organs. If leaves are found,
it is almost certain that scarcely any portion of the stem will be attached to them; if the
external parts of a trunk, then very rarely any vestiges of the branches and foliage. And when
traces of the internal structure can be discovered, it is seldom that the external character of the
stem remains.</p>

<p>"In consequence of this deficiency of the essential characters on which the determinations
of the botanist are founded, there exists a necessity for examining more minutely and accurately
than has yet been done, the internal structure of recent plants; their habits of growth, the
cicatrices or scars left on the stem by the leaves that are spontaneously shed, the different
appearances which their fruits exhibit in their various stages of development&mdash;all these points
must be minutely studied before we can obtain any certainty as to the identity of fossil and
living species of plants.</p>

<p>"It is not by publishing detached and unconnected delineations and descriptions of fossil
plants, as they occasionally occur, that the knowledge of them can be considerably promoted.
A systematic arrangement must be formed; and the first step to this is the accurate determination
of the species. <i>Hoc opus, hic labor est.</i>"</p>

<p>"It will be seen," he observes, "in the course of this work, how easy it would be to
imagine parts of the same specimen to be different species, when they happen to be broken
and dispersed. I can confidently assert, that in at least a thousand different specimens which
I have had in my possession, not more than a hundred distinct species can be recognised.
Furthermore, still fewer indeed can be referred to any living species; for it is not the fern-like
leaf of a plant, the palm-like cicatrix, or the cane-like joint of a stem, that will suffice
to identify them with those tribes of the vegetable kingdom. The whole anatomy of the
plant must be studied. The subject has, indeed, been begun by Professor Martins, in his
comparison of certain fossil stems of plants with those of the living plants growing in the Brazils,
but the study is as yet too new to afford certain results. Accordingly, several of that professor's
opinions are at variance with those of M. Adolphe Brongniart, who has also compared the recent
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[ 176 ]</a></span>
and fossil vegetables together on this plan. But by following up the comparison, which has
been so successfully adopted by Baron Cuvier, in the study of fossil animals,<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> similar results
may be expected, and a knowledge of the extinct plants be at length attained."</p>

<p>Mr. Artis then gives an abstract of the systems of Baron Schlotheim, Count Sternberg,
Professor Martins, and M. Adolphe Brongniart, which I am Induced to subjoin as a useful
record of the state of fossil botany twelve years ago:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Baron Schlotheim, who published in 1804 the first part of a Flora der Vorwelt,
followed up his researches of this kind by a catalogue of his cabinet, under the title of 'Die
Petrefactenkunde auf ihrem jetzigen Standpunkte erl&auml;utert,' published in 1820, to which two
Appendices have since been added in 1822 and 1823.</p>

<p>"The arrangement made by the Baron, so far as regards the vegetable part of his cabinet,
is as follows. His specimens are first divided into five Sections, or Orders:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Dendrolithes</span>, containing the remains of trees, which are subdivided into three
sub-sections.</p>

<p>A. <i>Lithoxylites</i>, of which no characters are given, but from the specimens mentioned by
him, he evidently arranges in this place the wood-stone and wood-opal of the mineralogists.</p>

<p>B. <i>Lithanthracites</i>, in which are placed the bituminized stems, and other parts of trees.</p>

<p>C. <i>Bibliolithes</i>.&mdash;Fossil leaves, mostly of the later formations.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Botanolithes.</span>&mdash;Comprising those kinds of fossil plants which cannot be considered
either as trees or shrubs, nor as belonging to the plants of the old coal formation.</p>

<p>All the specimens belonging to the preceding sections are merely enumerated, and not distinguished
by generic and trivial names, as is the case with the following.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phytotypolithes.</span>&mdash;Fossil plants of the stone-coal formation. These are divided systematically
into genera and species. The genera are as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>
a. <i>Palmacites</i>, containing fifteen species.<br />
b. <i>Casuarinites</i>,    "     five.<br />
c. <i>Calamites</i>,       "     ten.<br />
d. <i>Filicites</i>,       "     twenty-three.<br />
e. <i>Lycopodiolithes</i>, "     five.<br />
f. <i>Poacites</i>,        "     four.<br />
</p>

<p>In the whole sixty-two species.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Carpolithes.</span>&mdash;Of which he enumerates fifteen species as present in his collection. This
division is considered as a genus, as is also the next.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Anthotypolithes.</span>&mdash;The cabinet contains only one species, namely the <i>Anthotypolithes
ranunculiformis</i>."</p>

<p>In 1820, Gaspard Count Sternberg published in German, the first number of a work which
has been translated by the Comte de Bray, under the title of "Essai d'un Expos&eacute; Geognostico-Botanique
de la Flore du Monde Primitif." Of this translation a second and third part
appeared in 1823 and 1824. In these successive numbers the Count has communicated the state
of his knowledge as it grew up under his hands, in consequence of his own labours and those
of his friend, Baron Schlotheim. The genera, as they are successively developed in the work,
are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>This genus is subdivided in the first number into two sub-genera, but this division is not
noticed in the additional species quoted in the succeeding numbers.</p>

<p>4. <i>Syringodendron.</i>&mdash;Stem arborescent, in the form of pipes agglutinated together, with
naked glandules surrounding the stem spirally.</p>
</div>

<p>In the second number the following genera are given:&mdash;</p>

<p>8. <i>Annularia.</i>&mdash;Leaves disposed in a whirl, inserted in a proper ring.</p>

<p>9. <i>N&#339;ggerathia.</i>&mdash;Stem as thick as a goose-quill; leaves alternate, approximate, reverse-ovate,<br />

has changed into <i>Sargassum</i>; that celebrated algologist having considered it as<br />
identically the same as that genus of recent algæ.</p>

<p>In November 1821, Professor Martins read to the Botanical Society of Ratisbon, a paper
which was afterwards published in its Memoirs for 1822. This paper was entitled, "<i>De Plantis

species mentioned by Baron Schlotheim and Count Sternberg are referred to the orders and

<p>The numerous additions and modifications, which subsequent experience and discoveries
have led M. Brongniart to introduce into his classification, will be found in an article recently
published (1849) in the "Dictionnaire Universel d'Histoire Naturelle," under the title of
"Tableau des Genres de V&eacute;g&eacute;taux Fossiles, consid&eacute;r&eacute;s sous le point de vue de leur classification
botanique et de leur distribution g&eacute;ologique."</p>


<p><a id="SupNote_5">V.</a> <span class="smcap">Fossil Cephalopoda, Nautilus, Ammonite</span>, &amp;c.&mdash;The fossil remains of the molluscous
animals, named <i>Cephalopoda</i>, from their organs of prehension being arranged around the head or
upper part of the body, are the most ancient, numerous, and interesting, of this class of animated
nature in the mineral kingdom. These relics are among the most varied and striking of the extinct
beings that occur in the sedimentary strata, from the most ancient secondary formations, to the
most recent tertiary. The living species are but a feeble representation of the countless myriads
which must have swarmed in the ancient seas.</p>

<p>The animal of the Cephalopods is composed of a body, which is either enclosed in a shell, as
in the Nautilus, or contains a calcareous osselet or support, as in the Sepia or Cuttle-fish; it has
a distinct head, and eyes as perfect as in the vertebrated animals, with complicated organs of
hearing, and a powerful masticating apparatus, surrounded by arms or tentacula. Below the
head there is a tube which acts as a locomotive instrument, to propel the animal backwards, by
the forcible ejection of the water that has served the purpose of respiration, and which can be
ejected with considerable force by the contraction of the body.</p>

<p>Their fossil remains consist of the external shell and the internal osselet; and in the naked
tribes, of the soft parts of the body, the ink-bag, &amp;c., as noticed in the account of the Belemnite
and Belemnoteuthis.</p>

<p>The shell varies exceedingly in the different genera. In the group characterised by smooth
septa, and a medial or submedial siphuncle, as the Nautilus, the earliest or most ancient type is
straight, as in the <i>Orthoceras</i> (<a href="#Plate_58">Plate LVIII.</a> fig. 14) of the palæozoic formations; the intermediate
forms present various modifications of the spiral, and terminate in the completely discoidal shell of
the living genus; while the other group, that with sinuous or foliated septa and a dorsal siphuncle,
commences in a discoidal type&mdash;the Ammonite, which gradually passes through the various
modifications of <i>Crioceras</i>, <i>Scaphites</i> (<a href="#Plate_61">Plate LXI.</a> fig. 10), <i>Hamites</i> (<a href="#Plate_61">Plate LXI.</a> fig. 3), <i>Turrilites</i>
(<a href="#Plate_61">Plate LXI.</a> fig. 12), &amp;c.; and finally becomes extinct in the straight Baculites (<a href="#Plate_55">Plate LX.</a> fig. 2).</p>

<p>In argillaceous strata, as the Kimmeridge and Oxford clay, London clay, &amp;c., the shells of
Cephalopoda are oftentimes beautifully preserved; the chambers are frequently filled with the
solid matrix, but in many instances these cavities are lined either with brilliant pyrites or spar.
Stony or sparry casts of the cells or chambers, the shell having perished, are another common

state in which vestiges of these animals occur. Sometimes the cast of each chamber is isolated,
so as to present a series from the innermost to the outermost cell. Sections of those casts, in
which the chambers are filled up with spar, constitute specimens of great beauty and interest.
The so-called snake-stones are, of course, mere casts of Ammonites;<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> those of Whitby, from the
lias limestone, are well known to every collector; the casts of a very large species are common in
the oolite, especially at Swindon, in Wiltshire, and in the neighbourhood of Bath.</p>


<p><a id="SupNote_6">VI.</a> <span class="smcap">The Carboniferous Deposits, or Coal Measures.</span>&mdash;The various deposits of Coal have
manifestly been formed under different local circumstances. Some have been peat-bogs, to
which repeated additions have been made by successive subsidences of the land; others have
been deposited at the bottom of lakes and rivers, and these are associated with remains of fresh-water
shells and Crustacea; others have accumulated in the abyss of the ocean, having been
formed by the drifting and engulfing of immense rafts of trees and other vegetable matter, like
those of the Mississippi; others in inland seas, the successive layers of vegetables having been
supplied by periodical land-floods. There can be no doubt that coal has been, and may be,
produced under all these conditions; and at different periods, and in various localities, all these
causes may have been in operation. But the great series of ancient coal-formations present a
remarkable uniformity of character, not only throughout Europe, but also in America and other
parts of the world. A coal-field (as a group of strata of this kind is commonly termed), is
generally composed of a series of layers of coal, clay, shale, and sand, of variable thicknesses,
based on grit or limestone, abounding in marine shells and corals; and the most remarkable
phenomenon is the constant presence <i>beneath</i> every bed of coal, of a thick stratum of earthy clay,
and of a layer of shale or slaty clay above it. One of the series of triple deposits of which a coal-field
consists, presents therefore the following characters:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Under-clay</i>; the lowermost stratum. This is a tough argillaceous earth or clay, which on
drying becomes of a grey colour, and very friable; it is occasionally black, from an intermixture
of carbonaceous matter. This bed almost invariably contains an abundance of <i>Stigmariæ</i> (see
Plates XXII. XXIII.), of considerable length, with their rootlets attached, and which extend in
every direction through the clay (as shown in the figures 1, 2, 6, pp. 199, 201). These roots
commonly lie parallel with the planes of the stratum, and nearer to the top than to the bottom.</p>

<p>2. <i>Coal.</i>&mdash;A carbonized mass, in which the external forms of the plants and trees composing
it are obliterated, but the internal structure, in many instances, remains. Large trunks, and
stems, and leaves, are rarely found in it.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Roof</i>, or upper bed.&mdash;This consists of slaty clay, abounding in leaves, trunks and
branches, fruit, &amp;c.; it includes layers and nodules of ironstone, inclosing leaves, insects,
Crustacea, &amp;c. In some localities beds of fresh-water shells, in others of marine shells, are
intercalated with the shale; finely laminated clay, micaceous sand, grit, and pebbles of limestone,
sandstone, &amp;c. are also often interstratified. The principal illustrative specimens of the leaves,
fruit, &amp;c. (as those in <a href="#Plate_30">Plate XXX.</a> to <a href="#Plate_34">Plate XXXIV.</a>) are found in this bed.</p>

<p>Thus an uninterrupted series of strata, in which triple deposits of this kind are repeated,
(often thirty or forty times, and through a thickness of several thousand feet,) constitutes the
predominant character of the ancient coal formations wherever they have been explored. The
difficulties attending a satisfactory solution of this problem, are fully stated in the last edition of
my Wonders of Geology (Vol. ii. Lecture vii.), and to that work I must refer the reader for a
more extended consideration of this highly interesting subject.</p>

<p><a id="SupNote_7">VII.</a> <span class="smcap">Coal.</span>&mdash;The numerous fossil plants from the carboniferous strata that are figured in
this work, render it necessary to put the general reader in possession of a concise view of the
nature and mode of formation of those ancient accumulations of vegetable matter, which now
constitute the beds of mineral fuel termed coal.</p>

<p>Although at the present time no one at all conversant with geology doubts the vegetable
origin of <span class="smcap">Coal</span>, the period is not distant when many eminent philosophers were sceptical on this
point; and the truth in this, as in most other questions In natural philosophy, was established
with difficulty. The experiments and observations of the late Dr. Macculloch mainly contributed
to solve the problem as to the vegetable origin of this substance; and that eminent geologist
successfully traced the transition of vegetable matter from peat-wood, brown coal, lignite, and jet,
to coal, anthracite, graphite, and plumbago. Nor must the important labours of Mr. Parkinson
in this field of research be forgotten. The first volume of the "Organic Remains of a former
World," which treats of vegetable fossils, contains much original and valuable information on the
transmutation of vegetable matter, by bituminous fermentation, into the various mineral substances
in which its original nature and structure are altogether changed and obliterated; and that work
may still be consulted with advantage by the student.</p>

<p>But though the vegetable origin of all coal will not admit of question, yet evidence of the
original structure of the plants or trees whence it was derived is not always attainable. The
most perfect coal seems to have undergone a complete liquefaction, and if any portions of the
vegetable tissue remain, they appear as if imbedded in a pure bituminous mass. The slaty coal
generally preserves traces of cellular or vascular tissue, and the spiral vessels and dotted cells of
coniferous trees may often be detected by the microscope. In many instances the cells are filled
with an amber-coloured resinous substance; in others the organization is so well preserved, that
on the surface of a block of coal cracked by heat, the vascular tissue, and the dotted glands, may
be observed. Some beds of coal appear to be wholly composed of minute leaves or disintegrated
foliage; for if a mass recently extracted from the mine be split asunder, the exposed surfaces are
found covered with delicate laminæ of carbonized leaves and fibres matted together; and flake
after flake may be peeled off through a thickness of many inches, and the same structure be
apparent. Rarely are any large trunks or branches observable in the beds of coal; but the
general appearance of the carboniferous mass is that of an immense deposit of delicate foliage
shed and accumulated in a forest, and consolidated by great pressure while undergoing that
peculiar process by which vegetable matter is converted into carbon.</p>

<p>The essential conditions for the transmutation of vegetable substances into coal, appear to be
the imbedding of large quantities of recent vegetables beneath deposits which shall exclude the
air, and prevent the escape of the gaseous elements when released by decomposition from their
organic combination; hence, according as these conditions have been more or less perfectly
fulfilled, coal, jet, lignite, brown-coal, peat-wood, &amp;c. will be the result.</p>


<p><a id="SupNote_8">VIII.</a> <span class="smcap">Fossil Corals.</span>&mdash;The real nature even of recent Corals is in general so imperfectly
understood by the intelligent reader who has not paid especial attention to the department
of natural history which treats of the class of animated nature termed Zoophytes, that in
describing the Fossil Corals In my Wonders of Geology, I felt it necessary to devote one Lecture
to the consideration of Corals and Crinoidea, in order to afford a popular exposition of the
structure and economy of these highly Interesting tribes of animal existence.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_105" id="Footnote_105"></a><a href="#FNanchor_105"><span class="label">[105]</span></a> See Wonders of Geology, vol. ii. Lect. vi. p. 588.</p></div>

<p>A very prevalent error regarding their nature Is, that the beautiful stony substances generally
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[ 183 ]</a></span>
called corals, are fabricated by the animalcules which inhabit the cells when living, in the same
manner as is the honeycomb of the bee and wasp. This opinion is utterly erroneous: the coral
is secreted by the integuments or membranes with which when recent it was invested and
permeated; in like manner as are the bones of the skeleton in the higher orders of animals
by the tissues designed for that especial purpose, and wholly without the cognisance or control
of the creature of which they constitute the internal support.</p>

<p>A general idea of the nature of the compound coral-zoophytes may be obtained by the
examination of the common <i>Flustra</i> or Sea-mat. This form of polyparia, when taken out of
the water, appears to the naked eye like a patch of fine varnished net-work, adhering to a piece
of sea-weed or stone; when viewed with a magnifying lens of moderate power, the surface
is found beset with pores regularly disposed: and if the Flustra be examined while immersed in
sea-water, its surface is seen to be invested by a gelatinous substance, and every pore is the
aperture of a cell, whence issues a tube fringed at the extremity with long tentacula or feelers.
These expand, then suddenly contract, withdraw into the cell, and again issue forth: the whole
surface of the Flustra being studded with the hydra-like animalcules; each enjoying a distinct
existence, the entire group being united by one common integument or calcareous frame-work.
When the Flustra is exposed to the air, the polypes soon perish, the animal matter rapidly
decomposes, and the calcareous lace-like skeleton alone remains. In the larger and more
compact corals the phenomena are similar, differing only in degree. In a fossil state, the durable
remains of the corals consist for the most part of the calcareous frame-work (or polyparium,
as it is termed), which often possesses a crystalline structure; and in some instances is completely
transmuted into silex, as in specimens from Antigua, the Falls of the Ohio, and from Tisbury
in Wiltshire. (See <a href="#Plate_38">Plate XXXVIII.</a> figs. 12, 13.)</p>

<p>I must refer to the Wonders of Geology for a more extended notice of fossil corals, and
other zoophytes, and will only add that the calcareous and siliceous spines or spicula, not only
of sponges, but also of Gorgoniæ, and other corals, are often met with in a fossil state.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p><a id="SupNote_9">IX.</a> <span class="smcap">Cuvier's Discoveries.</span> <i>The Fossil Quadrupeds of Montmartre.</i> (<a href="#Plate_72">Plate LXXII.</a>)&mdash;The
Palæotheria, Anoplotheria, and other genera of extinct quadrupeds related to the <i>Tapir</i>, whose
remains were first noticed in the gypseous limestone of Montmartre, near Paris, and which have
since been found in many other localities of the same strata, are familiar to every one, from the
just celebrity attached to the labours of the illustrious Cuvier, who restored as it were these
lost denizens of an earlier world, in their native character and forms, and distinguished them
by names long since become classical in the sciences which treat of the ancient history of the
earth and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>The gypsum quarries spread over the flanks of Montmartre were many years since known
to contain fossil bones of extinct quadrupeds, and some of these had been figured and described
in 1768 by Guettard, and afterwards by Pralon, Lamanon, and Parumot: but it was not till the
attention of M. Cuvier was directed to the subject by some specimens put into his hands by
M. Vuarin, that the interest and importance of these fossils were understood. The curiosity
of Baron Cuvier was so much excited by an inspection of a large collection of these bones, soon
after he had been successfully engaged in the investigation of the remains of fossil Elephants
and Mastodons, that he immediately began to obtain specimens from the quarries, and by
liberally rewarding the workmen, and by unremitting personal research, he soon accumulated
an immense quantity of bones of all sorts, belonging to numerous individuals. He now perceived
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[ 184 ]</a></span>
that a new world was open to his view: and to use his own expressive language, he found
himself in an ancient charnel-house, surrounded by a confused multitude of mangled skeletons
of a great variety of unknown beings. To arrange each fragment in its proper place, and
restore order to these heterogeneous materials, seemed at first a hopeless task: but a knowledge
of the immutable laws by which the organization of animal existence is governed, soon
enabled him to assign to each bone, and even fragment, its proper place in the skeleton; and
the forms of beings hitherto unseen by mortal eye appeared before him. "I cannot," he
exclaims, "express my delight in finding how the application of one principle was instantly
followed by the most triumphant results. The essential character of a tooth and its relation
to the skull being determined, all the other elements of the fabric immediately fell into their
proper places; and the vertebra, ribs, bones of the legs, thigh, and feet, seemed to arrange themselves
even without my bidding, and in the very manner I had predicted." The principles of
the correlation of structure which his profound researches in comparative anatomy had enabled
him to establish, conducted to these important results, and laid the foundation of that science
which has since received the name of Palæontology.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The mode of induction adopted by this
illustrious philosopher, has been the mighty instrument by which subsequent labourers in this
department of science have so largely contributed to our knowledge of the ancient condition
of the earth, and of the structure and economy of the tribes of beings which have successively
dwelt upon it. The examination of the fossil teeth (in <a href="#Plate_72">Plate LXXII.</a> figs. 4-9) showed that the
animals were herbivorous; and the crown of the tooth being composed of two or three simple
crescents, as in certain pachydermata, proved that they differed from the ruminants, which have
double crescents, and each four bands of enamel. The two principal genera first established were
the <i>Palæotherium</i> and <i>Anoplotherium</i>. The first approximates to the Tapirs in the number and
disposition of the teeth; the second is remarkable in having no projecting canines, and in all
the teeth forming a continued series, as in the human race. Remains of both these genera
have been found in the eocene tertiary strata of the Isle of Wight,<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and on the coast of
Hampshire.</p>

<p><a id="SupNote_10">X.</a> <span class="smcap">Fossil Edentata.</span> <i>Megatherium, and Megalonyx</i>. (Plates LXXII. and LXXIII.)&mdash;The
remains of these and other allied forms of the extinct gigantic Edentata, which once inhabited
South America, occur in immense quantities throughout the Pampas&mdash;those vast plains which present
a sea of waving grass for 900 miles. These plains consist of alluvial loam and sand, containing
fresh-water and marine shells of existing species; they were evidently once, like Lewes Levels,
a gulf or arm of the sea. Since the publication of Mr. Parkinson's work, vast numbers of bones
have been exhumed, and many most interesting specimens sent to England by Sir Woodbine
Parish, and Charles Darwin, Esq., in whose charming "Journal of Researches into the Natural
History and Geology of the Countries visited during the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle round
the World," will be found many highly graphic notices of the discovery of these remains.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
Mr. Darwin, under the head of <i>Bahia Blanca</i>,<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> describes the remains of no less than nine great
quadrupeds found imbedded within the space of 200 square yards. They consisted of three
heads and other bones of the <i>Megatherium</i>, of enormous dimensions; and bones of the <i>Megalonyx</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[ 185 ]</a></span>
Of the <i>Scelidotherium</i>, an allied animal, Mr. Darwin obtained an almost perfect skeleton; it must
have been as large as a rhinoceros; in the structure of the head, it approaches nearest the Cape
ant-eater, in other respects it is related to the armadilloes. Remains of a different species of
Mylodon, of another gigantic edental quadruped, and of a large animal with an osseous dermal coat
in compartments, very like that of the Armadillo. Of this last, which has been named <i>Glyptodon</i>,
there is a very fine specimen in the Hunterian Museum. Teeth and bones of an extinct species
of horse, and of an unknown pachyderm, a huge beast with a long neck like the camel. Lastly
the <i>Toxodon</i> (so named from the remarkable curvature of the teeth); this is perhaps one of the
strangest animals ever discovered. In size it equals the elephant or megatherium, but the
structure of its teeth shows it to have been intimately related to the gnawers&mdash;the order which
at the present day includes the smallest quadrupeds. In many details it approaches to the
pachydermata; judging from the position of its eyes, it was probably aquatic, like the Dugong
and Manatee, to which it is also allied.</p>

<p>The beds containing the above fossil remains, consist of stratified gravel and reddish mud,
and stand only from fifteen to twenty feet above the level of high water; hence the elevation of
the land has been small since the great quadrupeds wandered over the surrounding plains; and
the external features of the country must then have been very nearly the same as now.</p>

<p>In another place, Mr. Darwin observes,&mdash;"The number of the remains of these large
quadrupeds imbedded in the grand estuary deposit which forms the Pampas and covers the
granitic rocks of Banda Oriental, must be extraordinarily great. I believe, a straight line drawn
in any direction through the Pampas, would cut through some skeleton or bones. Besides those
which I found during my short excursions, I heard of many others; and the origin of such names
as, 'the stream of the animal,' 'the hill of the giant,' is obvious. At other times, I heard of the
marvellous property of certain rivers, which had the power of changing small bones into large;
or as some maintained, the bones themselves grew. As far as I am aware, not one of these
animals perished, as was formerly supposed, in the marshes or muddy river-beds of the present
land, but their bones have been exposed by the streams intersecting the subaqueous deposit, in
which they were originally imbedded. We may conclude that the whole area of the Pampas
is one wide sepulchre of these extinct gigantic quadrupeds."<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p><a id="SupNote_11">XI.</a> <span class="smcap">Flint.</span>&mdash;<i>Animal Remains in siliceous nodules.</i>&mdash;So many beautiful specimens of siliceous
petrifactions&mdash;that is, animal and vegetable remains transmuted into silex or flint&mdash;are figured
in the subjoined plates, that it may be useful to offer a few remarks on this subject.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> In
many instances the organic remains in chalk-flints are simply incrusted by the silex; such is the
state of numerous sponges which are as it were invested by the flint, and have all their pores and
tubes filled up by the same material, the original tissue appearing as a brown calcareous
substance. In other examples, the sponge has been enveloped in a mass of liquid flint, and has
subsequently perished and decomposed; in this manner have been formed those hollow nodules,
which on being broken present a cavity containing only a little white powder, or some fragments
of silicified sponge; in many instances the cavity is lined with quartz crystals, or mammillated
chalcedony. Frequently but part of the zoophyte is permeated by the silex, and the other
portion is in the state of a friable calcareous earth imbedded in the chalk. Sponges and other
zoophytes often form the nuclei of the flint nodules; the original substance of the organic
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[ 186 ]</a></span>
body being in general silicified, and the most delicate internal structure preserved. Shells,
corals, and the minute cases of foraminifera, are often immersed as it were in pure flint, appearing
as if preserved in a semi-transparent medium.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_112" id="Footnote_112"></a><a href="#FNanchor_112"><span class="label">[112]</span></a> See Wonders of Geology, vol. i. pp. 74-105, for a general view of the process of petrifaction.</p></div>

<p>But there are innumerable flint nodules in which no traces of spongeous tissue are apparent,
and veins, dikes, and sheets of tabular flint, that are in a great measure free from organic
remains; containing only such as may be supposed to have become imbedded in a stream of
fluid silex that flowed over a sea-bottom. Wood perforated by lithodomi and silicified, is
occasionally met with; and fuci or algæ are sometimes found, appearing as if floating in the
liquid flint.</p>

<p>For the most part, the minute shells in the chalk and flint are filled with amorphous mineral
matter; but in many examples, (as I have ascertained by direct experiment,) the soft parts of
foraminifera remain in the shell.</p>


<p><a id="SupNote_12">XII.</a> <span class="smcap">Foraminifera.</span>&mdash;<a href="#Plate_62">Plate LXII.</a> contains figures of several species belonging to various
genera of those minute fossil shells, the discoidal involute forms of which were once considered
to belong to the Cephalopoda, and to be related to the Nautilus, Spirula, &amp;c., but which are now
grouped in one family, under the name of <i>Foraminifera</i>; a term derived from the foramina or
perforations with which their shells are traversed, and which have relation to the peculiar
organization of the animals.</p>

<p>Since microscopic observations have become so general, thanks to the genius and enthusiasm
of Ehrenberg, these fossil bodies have acquired a degree of interest and importance, unsurpassed
by more obvious organic remains. Whole mountain chains and extensive tracts of country are
now known to be almost entirely composed of the aggregated shells of a few genera of these
<i>microzoa</i>.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> In other deposits their remains are associated with those of <i>Infusoria</i>,<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> (both animal
and vegetable,) still more infinitesimal. As much error prevails among collectors as to the
real nature of the fossil foraminifera, I am induced to annex the following remarks.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

Bassin Tertiaire de Vienne, (Autriche)." Paris, 1846. 1 vol. 4to, with plates.</p></div>

<p>The foraminifera are marine animals of low organization, and, with but few exceptions,
extremely minute: in an ounce of sea-sand between three and four millions have been distinctly
enumerated. When living, they are not aggregated, but always individually distinct; they are
composed of a body (or vital mass) of a gelatinous consistence, which is either entire, and round,
or divided into segments, placed either on a simple or alternate line, or coiled spirally, or
involuted round an axis. This body is covered with an envelope or shell, which is generally
testaceous, rarely cartilaginous, and is modelled on the segments, and follows all the modifications
of form and contour of the body. From the extremity of the last segment, there issue, sometimes
from one, sometimes from several openings of the shell, or through numerous pores or foramina,
very elongated, slender, contractile, colourless filaments, more or less divided and ramified,
serving for prehension, and capable of entirely investing the shell. The body varies in colour,
but is always identical in individuals of the same species,&mdash;it is yellow, fawn-coloured, red,
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[ 187 ]</a></span>
violet, blue, &amp;c. Its consistence is variable; it is composed of minute globules, the aggregation
of which determines the general tint. It is sometimes entire, round, and without segments, as
in <i>Gromia</i>, <i>Orbulina</i>, &amp;c., which represent, at all ages, the embryonic state of all the other genera.
They increase, without doubt, by the entire circumference. When the body is divided by lobes
or segments, the primary lobe, as in the permanent condition of the Gromia, is at first round or
oval, according to the genus; once formed it never enlarges, but is enveloped externally by
testaceous matter; it may be compared to a ball on which is applied a second larger one, then a
third still larger, and so on during the life of the animal.</p>

<p>The annexed figure of the animal of <i>Nummulina</i> (as given by MM. Joly and Leymerie) will
serve to convey a general idea of the living Foraminifera.</p>

<p>The segments, as the body increases, are agglomerated in six different ways, and these modifications
are the basis of M. D'Orbigny's classification. The discoidal forms, as the <i>Rotalia</i>,
<i>Rosalina</i>, <i>Cristellaria</i>, &amp;c. are involuted like the nautilus, and divided by septa or partitions, the
different lobes of the body occupying contemporaneously every chamber, and being connected by
a tube or canal that extends through the entire series. In the spiral forms, the <i>Textilaria</i>, &amp;c.
the same structure is apparent. These two groups are the most abundant in the cretaceous
strata; many beds of the white chalk consist almost wholly of the aggregated shells of the
Rosalinæ, Rotaliæ, and Textilariæ.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Whatever the form of the body, the filaments always consist of
a colourless matter as transparent as glass; they elongate from the base to six times the diameter
of the shell. They often divide and subdivide, so as to appear branched. Though alike in form
in the different genera, they vary much in their position. In some they form a bundle which
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[ 188 ]</a></span>
issues from a single opening, and is withdrawn into the same by contraction; in others the
filaments project only through each of the pores in the shell which covers the last segment; in
others they issue from both the large aperture and the foramina. In fine, these filaments or
pseudopodia fulfil in the foraminifera the functions of the numerous tentacula in the Asteriadæ,
or Star-fishes, serving as instruments of locomotion and attachment.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_116" id="Footnote_116"></a><a href="#FNanchor_116"><span class="label">[116]</span></a> See Wonders of Geology, p. 299</p></div>

<p>Neither organs of nutriment nor of reproduction have been detected. In the genera having
one large aperture from which the filaments issue and retract, we can conceive nutriment to be
absorbed by that opening; but this cannot be the case in the species which have the last cell
closed up; in these the filaments issuing through the foramina are probably also organs of nutrition.
M. D'Orbigny considers the Foraminifera as constituting a distinct class in zoology; less
complicated than the Echinoderms and the Polypiaria in their internal organization, they have
by their filaments the mode of locomotion of the first, and by their free, individual existence&mdash;not
aggregated and immovably fixed&mdash;they are more advanced in the scale of being than the latter.
To me they appear to be merely hydra-form polypes of the most simple structure, protected
by shells;<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> those composed of different segments, I conceive to be a single aggregated individual,
and not a successive series of beings.</p>

<p>The white chalk is well known to be largely composed of a few kinds of foraminifera, but the
occurrence of the soft bodies of these animalcules in a fossil state was first discovered by me, in
1845, in chalk-flints, and was announced in a paper, read before the Geological Society, entitled,
"<i>Notes of a Microscopical Examination of Chalk and Flint</i>."<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> This statement was regarded
by some eminent palæontologists as so "startling and unsatisfactory," that I resumed the investigation,
and communicated the result to the Royal Society, in a memoir "<i>On the Fossil Remains
of the Soft Parts of Foraminifera discovered in the Chalk and Flint of the South-East of England</i>;"<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
and with the kind assistance of that able chemist and microscopist, Mr. Henry Deane, of Clapham
Common, I obtained, by immersing chalk in dilute hydrochloric acid, and mounting the residue in
Canada balsam, several specimens of the entire integuments of the bodies of Rotaliæ, as distinct
as if recent! This fact is now admitted; and the experiment has been successfully repeated in
India, by Mr. Carter, on the limestones of that country;<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and in America, by Dr. Bailey, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
In some limestone recently collected by my eldest son, Mr. Walter Mantell, in the Middle
Island of New Zealand, and which, like our cretaceous strata, is almost entirely made up of
foraminifera, I have detected the soft parts of the bodies of Rotaliæ in the cells of the fossil shells,
as distinctly as in the chalk of England; and two of the species appear to be identical with
European forms.</p>

are known living in the Adriatic and the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Foraminifera are unknown in the Silurian and Devonian formations.</p>

<p><a id="SupNote_13">XIII.</a> <span class="smcap">Fossil Elk of Ireland</span>, or <i>Cervus megaloceros</i>. (<a href="#Plate_71">Plate LXXI.</a>)&mdash;The shell-marls of
Ireland contain in abundance the bones of an animal, which like the Dodo, was once contemporary
with the human species, but has long been extinct: the last individuals of the race were, in all
probability, exterminated by the early Celtic tribes. The remains of this noble creature
generally occur in the deposits of marl that underlie the peat-bogs, which are apparently, like
those of Scotland, the sites of ancient lakes or bays. In Curragh immense quantities of these
bones lie within a small area; the skeletons appear to be entire, and are found with the skull
elevated, and the antlers thrown back on the shoulders, as if a small herd of these Elks had
sought refuge in the marshes, and had been engulfed in the morass, in the same manner as the
Mastodons of America. (See description of <a href="#Plate_74">Plate LXXIV.</a>, ante, p. 167.)</p>

<p>This creature far exceeded in magnitude any living species of elk or deer. The skeleton is
upwards often feet in height to the top of the skull, and the antlers are from ten to fourteen feet from
one extremity to the other. The fine perfect skeletons in the British Museum, College of Surgeons,
and in the Museum at Edinburgh, render a particular description unnecessary. The bones
are generally well preserved, of a dark brown colour, with patches of blue phosphate of iron. In
some instances they are in so fresh a condition, that the hollows of the long bones contain marrow
having the appearance of fresh suet. Remains of this majestic animal have been found collocated
with ancient sepulchral urns, stone implements, and rude canoes, in such manner, as to leave no
doubt that this now extinct deer was coeval with the early human inhabitants of these Islands.
Its bones and antlers have been found at Walton, in Essex, associated with the remains of the
Mammoth, or fossil elephant.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p><a id="SupNote_14">XIV.</a> <span class="smcap">Fossil Infusoria</span>&mdash;<i>Infusorial Earths</i>.&mdash;In the note on Foraminifera some account is
given of various rocks composed of the fossil remains of those minute animals; but the durable
relics of the yet more infinitesimal organisms designated by the terms <i>Infusoria</i>, or <i>Infusorial
animalcules</i>, form deposits of equal interest and importance. Strata of great extent and thickness
are wholly, or in great part, made up of innumerable layers, consisting of the aggregated siliceous
cases or shields of Infusoria: and similar structures are found to be the chief constituents of the
white earthy deposits of lakes, rivers, and basins of brackish water, in every part of the world.</p>

<p>Slowly, imperceptibly, but incessantly, are the vital energies of the feeblest and minutest
animal and vegetable existences separating from the element in which they live, the most
enduring of mineral substances, silex&mdash;fabricating it into structures of the most exquisite forms
and sculpturing, and thus adding to the accumulations of countless ages, which make up the
sedimentary strata of the crust of the globe.</p>

<p>In the "Medals of Creation"<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> will be found a summary of what was then known as to the
formation and composition of many tertiary deposits which the indefatigable Ehrenberg, Dr.
Bailey, and other eminent observers, had carefully investigated and described. The five years
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[ 190 ]</a></span>
that have since elapsed have been fruitful in results of the most important and interesting
character; from every quarter of the world, from the loftiest mountain peaks, and from the
deepest recesses of the ocean which the plummet can reach, from the ashes of volcanoes and
from the snow of the glaciers, the durable remains of Infusoria have been obtained. That
excellent scientific periodical, Silliman's American Journal, contains numerous interesting
communications on this subject from the eminent chemical professor of the Military College
at West Point, Dr. J. W. Bailey; and the labours of Mr. Bowerbank, Williamson, and other
active members of the Microscopical Society of London, have yielded much interesting information
on the infusorial deposits of our own country.</p>

<p>The present note will be restricted to remarks on the nature of the organisms which enter
so largely into the composition of certain tertiary deposits; since the opinion once entertained
of the animal nature of many infusoria, now regarded as true vegetables, materially affects the
geological conclusions respecting the persistence of certain species of organisms through long
periods of time, during which the mollusca, zoophytes, &amp;c. underwent repeated mutations both
in the species and genera. Thus, for example, the <i>polierschiefer</i>, or polishing-slate of Bilin,
and the berghmehl of Tuscany, are described by Ehrenberg as masses of the siliceous shells
of animalcules of such extreme minuteness, that a cubic inch of the stone contains upwards of
forty millions; the infusorial earth of Richmond, in Virginia, in like manner, is stated to be
made up of the siliceous skeletons of animalcules of infinitesimal minuteness. But later investigations
have (I conceive) satisfactorily established, that the greater part of these fossil organisms
belongs to the vegetable and not to the animal kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> The whole of the figures in <a href="#Plate_4">Plate IV.</a>
of the "Medals of Creation," described as living Infusoria, on the authority of Ehrenberg, are
undoubted vegetables, belonging to the great botanical groups called <i>Diatomaceæ</i> (from the
angular segments into which they separate by partial division), and <i>Desmidiaceæ</i>.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The entire
family of <i>Bacillaria</i> belongs to this group. These simplest forms of vegetable structures abound
in every lake or stream of fresh and brackish water, in every pool, or bay, and throughout the
ocean, from the equator to the poles; they secrete siliceous envelopes, which present an endless
variety of form and structure, and after the death and decomposition of the perishable tissues
of the plants, remain as perfectly transparent colourless shields of pure silica; such are the
<i>Gaillonellæ</i>, <i>Euastra</i>, <i>Closteria</i>, <i>Naviculæ</i>, <i>Synhedræ</i>, <i>Podospheniæ</i>, <i>Xanthidia</i>, &amp;c., which constitute
so large a proportion of the infusorial earths described by Ehrenberg and other authors.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

by Messrs. Reeve &amp; Benham.</p></div>

<p>The extent of this infinitesimal flora throughout regions where no other forms of vegetation
are known, is strikingly demonstrated by the observations of the eminent botanist and traveller.
Dr. Hooker, in his account of the Antarctic regions.</p>

<p>"Everywhere," he states, "the waters and the ice alike abound in these microscopic vegetables.
Though too small to be visible to the unassisted eye, their aggregated masses stained the
iceberg and pack-ice wherever they were washed by the sea, and imparted a pale ochreous
colour to the ice. From the south of the belt of ice which encircles the globe, to the highest
latitudes reached by man, this vegetation is everywhere conspicuous, from the contrast between
its colour and that of the white snow and ice in which it is imbedded. In the eightieth degree
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[ 191 ]</a></span>
of south latitude all the surface ice carried along by currents, and the sides of every berg, and
the base of the great Victoria barrier itself&mdash;a perpendicular wall of ice, from one to two
hundred feet above the sea-level&mdash;were tinged brown from this cause, as if the waters were
charged with oxide of iron. The majority of these plants consist of simple vegetable cells,
enclosed in indestructible silex (as other <i>Algæ</i> are in carbonate of lime); and it is obvious that
the death of such multitudes must form sedimentary deposits of immense extent.</p>

<p>"The universal existence of such an invisible vegetation as that of the Antarctic ocean, is u
truly wonderful fact, and the more so, from its being unaccompanied by plants of a high order.
This ocean swarms with mollusca, and entomostracous crustaceans, small whales, and porpoises;
and the sea with penguins and seals, and the air with birds: the animal kingdom is everywhere
present, the larger creatures preying on the smaller, and these again on those more minute; all
living nature seems to be carnivorous. This microscopic vegetation is the sole nutrition of the
herbivorous animals; and it may likewise serve to purify the atmosphere, and thus execute in
the antarctic latitudes the office of the trees and grasses of the temperate regions, and the broad
foliage of the palms of the tropics."<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_127" id="Footnote_127"></a><a href="#FNanchor_127"><span class="label">[127]</span></a> From Dr. Hooker's account of the botany of the South Polar regions in Sir J. Ross's Voyages of Discovery.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Hooker also observes, that the siliceous cases of the same kind of Diatomaceæ now
living in the waters of the South Polar Ocean, have contributed in past ages to the formation
of European strata; for the tripoli and the phonolite stones of the Rhine contain the siliceous
shields of identical species. Such are the comments of one of our most eminent botanists on
the phenomena under review. The reader will probably ask,&mdash;What, then, are the essential
characters which separate the animal from the vegetable kingdom? To this question it is
impossible to give a satisfactory reply: perhaps the only distinction that will be generally
admitted by zoologists and botanists is the following:&mdash;<i>animals require organic substances for their
support; vegetables derive their sustenance from inorganic matter</i>.</p>

<p>The facts thus cursorily reviewed throw much doubt on many of M. Ehrenberg's statements
as to the identity of species of animalcules now living, with those whose remains occur in the
eocene, and in the secondary strata. The so-called <i>Xanthidia</i> of the chalk, are certainly
altogether distinct from the recent diatomæ to which the name was first applied; the chalk
organisms are probably the gemmules of sponges or other zoophytes.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_128" id="Footnote_128"></a><a href="#FNanchor_128"><span class="label">[128]</span></a> It would be convenient to distinguish these fossils by another name, and thus avoid the perpetuation of the error;
I would propose that of <i>Spiniferites</i>, in allusion to the numerous spines with which all the species are beset.</p></div>

<p>Infusorial earths may therefore be composed either of microscopic vegetable or animal remains,
or of both. The brackish and fresh-water deposits I have examined are siliceous and almost wholly
diatomaceous: the marine calcareous strata composed of microscopic organisms, consist chiefly of
various kinds of foraminifera, a large proportion belonging to the polythalamia, or chambered
shells. I am not certain as to the animal or vegetable nature of some of the beautiful siliceous disks
(<i>Coscinodisci</i>, <i>Arachnoidisci</i>, <i>Actinocyclus</i>, &amp;c.) so abundant in the Richmond, Barbadoes, and Bermuda
infusorial earths, and which occur in so splendid a state in the Guano deposits of Ichaboe.</p>

<p>With the corrections which the above remarks will enable the reader to make, I would refer
to the account of Fossil Infusoria in the Medals of Creation, and Wonders of Geology. <a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

organic remains, had long since attracted the attention of naturalists, and rendered these quarries
celebrated throughout Europe. In 1770, M. Hoffman, the surgeon of the Fort, who had for some
years been assiduously collecting the fossils of this locality, had the good fortune to discover
a specimen which has conferred an enduring celebrity on his name. Some workmen, on blasting
the rock in one of the caverns of the interior of the mountain, perceived to their astonishment
the jaws of a large animal attached to the roof of the chasm. The discovery was immediately
made known to M. Hoffman, who repaired to the spot, and for weeks presided over the arduous
task of separating the mass of stone containing these remains from the surrounding rock. His
labours were rewarded by the successful extrication of the specimen, which he conveyed in
triumph to his house. This extraordinary discovery soon became the subject of general conversation,
and upon reaching the ears of the Canon of the cathedral which stands on the mountain,
excited in that functionary a determination to claim the fossil, in right of being lord of the
manor; and he unfortunately succeeded, after a long and harassing lawsuit, in obtaining this
precious relic. It remained for years in his possession, and Hoffman died without regaining his
treasure, or receiving any compensation. At length the French revolution broke out, and the
armies of the republic advanced to the gates of Maestricht. The town was bombarded; but at
the suggestion of the committee of savans who accompanied the French troops to select their
share of plunder, the artillery was not suffered to bombard that part of the city in which the
celebrated fossil was known to be preserved. In the mean time, the Canon of St. Peter's,
shrewdly suspecting the reason why such peculiar favour was shown to his residence, removed
the specimen, and concealed it in a vault; but when the city was taken, the French authorities
compelled him to give up his ill-gotten prize, which was immediately transmitted to the Jardin
des Plantes, at Paris, where it still forms one of the most striking objects in that magnificent
collection.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

with much sang froid, "La <i>justice</i>, quoique tardive, arrive enfin avec le tems!" The reader will probably think that although
the Canon was justly despoiled of his ill-gotten treasure, the French <i>savans</i> were a very equivocal personification of <i>Justice</i>!</p></div>

<p>The beautiful model of this most interesting fossil in the British Museum, was presented to
me by Baron Cuvier. It is four and a half feet long, and two and a half wide; it consists of the
jaws, with teeth, palatal bones, and the tympanic bone, or <i>os quadratum</i>, a bone possessed by
reptiles, as well as birds, and in which the auditory cells are contained. There are likewise some
fine portions of jaws, with teeth, in the British Museum, presented by Camper. The original
animal was probably a terrestrial reptile, holding an intermediate place between the Monitors and
Iguanas. It was about twenty-five feet long.</p>

<p>I discovered, many years since (1820), some vertebræ in the chalk near Lewes, which closely
resemble the corresponding bones of the Mosasaurus, and in all probability belong to another
species. In the cretaceous strata of New Jersey, Dr. Harlan found and described, and my
friend. Dr. Morton, of Philadelphia, sent me, in 1834, teeth which cannot be distinguished from
those of Maestricht. Vertebræ, and other bones, have since been obtained from the same deposits
by Professor Rogers, and described by Professor Owen in the Geological Journal.</p>


<p><a id="SupNote_16">XVI.</a> <span class="smcap">Fossil Reptiles.</span> Although when Mr. Parkinson's work was published many fossil bones
and teeth of reptiles had been discovered in various parts of England, yet the abundance and
variety, and the extraordinary modification of form and structure of this class of vertebrated animals,
which prevailed throughout the secondary geological formations, were not for a moment suspected.
The few examples of the remains of fossil reptiles described by Mr. Parkinson, serve to mark the
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[ 193 ]</a></span>
degree of knowledge which then existed respecting a department of palæontology that rapidly
acquired an importance and interest unsurpassed by any other branch of fossil osteology.</p>

<p>The announcement of the founder of palæontology,<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> that there was a period when the lakes
and rivers of our planet were peopled by reptiles, and cold-blooded oviparous quadrupeds of
appalling magnitude were the principal inhabitants of the dry land; when the seas swarmed with
saurians, exclusively adapted for a marine existence, and the regions of the atmosphere were
traversed by winged lizards instead of birds; was an enunciation so novel and startling, as to
require all the prestige of the name of Cuvier, to obtain for it any degree of attention and
credence, even with those who were sufficiently enlightened to admit, that a universal deluge
would not account for the physical mutations which the surface of the earth and its inhabitants
had, in the lapse of innumerable ages, undergone.</p>

<p>Subsequent discoveries have established the truth of this proposition to an extent beyond
what even its promulgator could have surmised; and the "<i>Age of Reptiles</i>" is now admitted into
the category of established facts.</p>

<p>During the incalculable ages which the formation of the various systems of secondary strata
must have comprised, we find no evidence in the fossils hitherto observed, of the existence of birds
and mammalia, as the characteristic types of the faunas of the dry land. On the contrary,
throughout the immense accumulations of the spoils of the ancient islands and continents, amidst
innumerable relics of reptiles of various orders and genera, a few jaws and bones of two or three
kinds of extremely small marsupials, and the bones of a species of wader, are the sole indications
of the presence of the two grand classes of Aves and Mammalia, which now constitute the chief
features of the terrestrial zoology of almost all countries.</p>

<p>The earliest indications of air-breathing vertebrata in the ancient secondary formations are
those of small saurian reptiles in the carboniferous strata; a few vestiges occur in the succeeding
group, the Permian. In the next epoch, the Triassic, colossal Batrachians (<i>Labyrinthodonts</i>) appear;
and on some of the strata of this formation are the footmarks of numerous bipeds, presumed to be
those of birds; but at present the evidence of the bones of the animals that made those imprints
is required to establish the hypothesis.</p>

<p>In the succeeding eras, the Lias, Oolite, Wealden, and Cretaceous, swarms of reptiles of
numerous genera and species everywhere prevail; reptiles fitted to fly through the air, to roam
over the land, to inhabit the lakes, rivers, and seas; and yet not one identical with any existing
forms! These beings gradually decline in numbers and species as we approach the close of the
secondary periods, and are immediately succeeded in the eocene epoch, by as great a preponderance
of warm-blooded vertebrata&mdash;birds and mammalia&mdash;as exists at the present time; and an
equal decadence in the class of reptiles. With the Cretaceous Formation the "Age of Reptiles"
may be said to terminate.</p>


<p><a id="SupNote_17">XVII.</a>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fossil Reptiles of the Wealden.</span> <i>The Iguanodon.</i> The fluviatile deposits (termed
<i>Wealden</i>), which in the south-east of England, and in the north of Germany, are intercalated
between the oolitic and cretaceous formations, abound in the bones of terrestrial, fresh-water,
and marine reptiles, comprising some of the most colossal land-saurians which have hitherto been
brought to light. These remains belong to various genera of Chelonians, Saurians, and Crocodilians;
and with these are associated those of flying lizards (<i>Pterodactyles</i>), Plesiosauri, gigantic
whale-like reptiles (<i>Cetiosauri</i>), and of other oviparous quadrupeds of unknown species and genera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[ 194 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The occurrence of fossils of this nature in the strata forming the districts denominated the
Wealds of Sussex and Kent, was first brought under the notice of geologists in 1822, in my
work on the "Fossils of the South Downs," in which the remains of several unknown reptiles
were described; and among them the teeth and bones of that extraordinary herbivorous lizard,
the <i>Iguanodon</i>, on which I am induced to offer a few observations in this place; the recent discovery
of some previously undetermined parts of the skeleton, having materially elucidated the
structure and economy of the original.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_132" id="Footnote_132"></a><a href="#FNanchor_132"><span class="label">[132]</span></a> The following is the description of the specimens first discovered, given in the "Fossils of the South Downs; or, Illustrations
of the Geology of Sussex," 1 vol. 4to. 1822: "Incisors and molar teeth evidently belonging to the same species of
animal: they differ from any previously known; the masticating surface is perfectly smooth and rather depressed in the
centre; these teeth consist of the crown only, and are quite solid. An incisor tooth 1.3 inch long Is slightly bowed and
smooth on its inner surface; but it has externally a ridge which extends longitudinally down the front. Its sides are angular
and the edges finely crenated." From the resemblance of these teeth in their general form to those of the Iguana, a common
land lizard in the West Indies, I subsequently proposed the name of <i>Iguanodon</i> (implying an animal having teeth like the
Iguana) for the fossil reptile. The teeth of an Iguana four or five feet long are not larger than those of a mouse; the
Iguanodon's teeth are as large as the incisors of the rhinoceros. The Iguana's teeth, when used, are chipped off at the points,
no existing reptile being capable of performing mastication; the teeth of the Iguanodon, on the contrary, are ground down
like the worn molars of herbivorous mammalia, as I pointed out in my first memoir in the Philos. Trans. 1825.</p></div>

<p>Since the first announcement of the discovery of the remains of the Iguanodon, vast quantities
of bones belonging to a great number of individuals of all ages have been collected; but until a
few years since, not a vestige of the jaws had been observed, notwithstanding the most diligent
research. In the early part of the year 1848, I was surprised and highly gratified by receiving
from Capt. Lambart Brickenden (at that time a personal stranger to me), who then resided at
Warminglid, near Cuckfield, in Sussex, the greater part of the right side (or <i>ramus</i>) of the lower
jaw, with several successional teeth in their natural position, of an adult Iguanodon.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> See p. 202.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_133" id="Footnote_133"></a><a href="#FNanchor_133"><span class="label">[133]</span></a> This beautiful and most instructive specimen is now in my possession; it is figured of the natural size in Philos. Trans.
Part ii. for 1848, Plate XVI., as well as the portion of upper jaw in the British Museum, Plate XIX. The character of the
upper and lower teeth of the Iguanodon are well represented in Plate XVIII. of the same memoir.
</p>

<p>A specimen very similar to that discovered by Capt. Brickenden, but of a young individual, was found soon afterwards
in a quarry near Horsham; but I was not allowed the privilege of figuring or describing it!</p></div>

<p>In the course of last summer I obtained a very instructive fragment of the middle part of the
right ramus of the lower jaw of a much larger Iguanodon, found by Mr. Fowlestone, with some
enormous bones of the extremities, in the Wealden strata of the Isle of Wight. A portion of
the upper jaw (without teeth) was discovered some years since in Tilgate Forest, and is deposited,
with the whole of the collection I formed at Brighton, in the gallery of organic remains of the
British Museum. These three specimens are the only parts of the jaws of the Iguanodon, with
the exception of a fragment of the angular bone, that I have had the opportunity of examining.
The other portions of the skeleton hitherto discovered are the following: the tympanic bone;<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
cervical, dorsal, lumbar, and caudal vertebræ, and chevron bones; ribs; the iliac bones, and
sacrum composed of six anchylosed vertebræ;<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> the coracoid, scapula and clavicles; humerus,
radius? metacarpals; femur, tibia and fibula, metatarsals and ungueals. The cranium, carpals,
and tarsals, have not been discovered.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_134" id="Footnote_134"></a><a href="#FNanchor_134"><span class="label">[134]</span></a> This may or may not belong to the Iguanodon: no tympanic bone has been found in such connexion with other parts
of the skeleton as to afford certain proof that this maxillary element is referable to the Iguanodon.</p></div>

<p>With the exception of the assemblage of bones promiscuously grouped together in a block of
<i>Kentish rag</i> (of the greensand formation), found in a quarry near Maidstone, by Mr. Bensted,
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[ 195 ]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
a few connected caudal vertebræ, and two or three instances in which a femur, tibia, and fibula
and some metatarsals, were found in contiguity, all the bones were isolated. They have been
obtained from the quarries in St. Leonard's and Tilgate Forests, near Loxwood, Rusper,
Horsham, Cuckfield, and Battel; and from the cliffs at Hastings, and in Sandown, and Brixton,
and Brook Bays, on the southern shore of the Isle of Wight.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_136" id="Footnote_136"></a><a href="#FNanchor_136"><span class="label">[136]</span></a> This most instructive specimen is in a glass-case on the floor near the window, in the middle room of the Gallery of
Organic Remains in the British Museum. All the Wealden reptilian remains of a large size, collected by me when residing
in Sussex, are in the upright glass cases in the same apartment.</p></div>

<p>So anomalous is the osteology of the Iguanodon compared with that of existing saurians, that
from my discovery of the first vestige of this reptile&mdash;a fragment of a tooth&mdash;thirty years ago,
to the recent important acquisition of the jaws, I have had to contend with the opposition of
eminent naturalists, who have refused assent to the physiological inferences suggested by the
specimens which were from time to time brought to light, because the modifications of structure
in a colossal herbivorous reptile, essentially differed from the hypothetical archetype skeleton of the
class to which it belonged. When the first discovered teeth were shown to Baron Cuvier, he
pronounced them to be the incisors of a Rhinoceros; the metatarsals, those of a Hippopotamus;
the fragment of a femur, with a medullary canal, that of some large mammalian. But the candour
and liberality of the founder of Palæontology were worthy of his transcendent genius; upon
receiving further evidence, he immediately acknowledged the error, and expressed his conviction
that the teeth and bones belonged to an herbivorous reptile more extraordinary than any that had
previously been brought under his notice.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_137" id="Footnote_137"></a><a href="#FNanchor_137"><span class="label">[137]</span></a> See Cuvier's Ossemens Fossiles, tom. v. part. ii. It is much to be wished that those who aspire to emulate this great
man in scientific fame, would also endeavour to imitate him in the yet nobler attributes of his character. It is stated by
Professor Owen, in Brit. Assoc. Reports on Fossil Reptiles, that the bones of the Iguanodon were interpreted by me with the
aid of Cuvier and Clift. This is a mistake. Baron Cuvier died before I had obtained any considerable portion of the
skeleton; and neither Mr. Clift nor Mr. Owen at that time could afford me any assistance in determining the nature of the
isolated bones I occasionally brought to the Hunterian Museum for comparison. Any aid I ever received in my investigations
is most fully acknowledged in my works.</p></div>

<p>Even the lower jaw, which presents characters so peculiar as to admit, as I conceive, of but
one interpretation&mdash;that enunciated in my memoir on the teeth and jaws of the Iguanodon,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>&mdash;has
been adduced as affording a signal instance of the incorrectness of my physiological deductions.
And why? Because in the entire class of living reptiles there is not a single species that has
cheeks and flexible lips, which, according to my view of the subject, the Iguanodon must have
possessed. But I do not hesitate to affirm that the structure and arrangement of the teeth, and
the mammalian character of the bones of the extremities, are in perfect accordance with my
exposition of the probable structure and functions of the maxillary organs of the original. The
naturalists who advance these objections, forget that among the existing mammalia there is one
genus, the <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>, or Duck-billed Platypus, that exhibits as striking a deviation from
the typical maxillary structure of its class, as does the Iguanodon. If before the discovery of
New Holland the jaw-bones of the Ornithorhynchus had been found in a fossil state in the strata
of Tilgate Forest, and I had ventured to infer that the original, though a true mammalian, and
giving suck to its young, had the extremities of the jaws covered with flat horny beaks, like
those of a duck, instead of with the fleshy lips and integuments which are the peculiar attributes
of its class, what censures would not my temerity have called forth! We cannot too often be
reminded of the profound remark of William Penn: "Experience, which is continually contradicting
theory, is the only test of truth."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_138" id="Footnote_138"></a><a href="#FNanchor_138"><span class="label">[138]</span></a> See Philosophical Transactions, Part II. 1848.</p></div>

<p>The following are the physiological inferences relating to the structure and habits of the
Iguanodon, which Dr. Melville and myself conceive our investigations have established: the
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[ 196 ]</a></span>
discovery of the cranium, and of perfect examples of the upper and lower jaws with both
successional and mature molars in their natural position, may modify, but, we believe, will in no
material respect invalidate these conclusions.</p>

<p>In instituting a comparison between the maxillary organs of the Iguanodon, and those of
the existing herbivorous lizards, we are at once struck with their remarkable deviation from all
known types in the class of reptiles. In the <i>Amblyrhynchi</i> (of the Galapagos Islands), the most
exclusively vegetable feeders of the Saurian order, the alveolar process beset with teeth is
continued round the front of the mouth: the junction of the two rami of the lower jaw at the
symphysis presenting no edentulous interval whatever, the lips not being more produced than in
other reptiles; but this creature only bruises its food; it cannot grind or masticate it. In fact,
the edentulous, expanded, scoop-shaped, procumbent symphysis of the lower jaw of the
Iguanodon, has no parallel among either recent or fossil reptiles; and we seek in vain for organs
at all analogous, except among the herbivorous mammalia. The nearest approach is to be found
in certain <i>Edentata</i>; as for example in the <i>Cholæpus didactylus</i>, or Two-toed Sloth, in which the
anterior part of the lower jaw is destitute of teeth, and much prolonged. The correspondence is
still closer in the extinct gigantic <i>Mylodons</i>, in which the symphysis resembles the blade of a
turf-spade, and has no traces of incisor sockets; and were not this part of the jaw elevated
vertically in front, and the two sides confluent, it would present the very counterpart of that of
the Iguanodon. The great number and size of the vascular foramina distributed along the outer
side of the dentary bone in the Wealden reptile, and the magnitude of the anterior outlets which
gave exit to the vessels and nerves that supplied the front of the mouth, indicate the great
development of the integuments and soft parts with which the lower jaw was invested.</p>

<p>The sharp ridge bordering the deep groove of the symphysis, in which there are also several
foramina, evidently gave attachment to the muscles and integuments of the under lip; and there
are strong reasons for supposing that the latter was greatly produced, and capable of being
protruded and retracted so as to constitute, in conjunction with a long extensile tongue, a suitable
instrument for seizing and cropping leaves and branches, which, from the construction of the
teeth, we may infer was the food of the Iguanodon.</p>

<p>Thus we find the mechanism of the maxillary organs of the Wealden herbivorous saurian,
as demonstrated by recent discoveries, in perfect harmony with the remarkable dental characters
which rendered the first known teeth so enigmatical. In the Iguanodon we have a solution of
the problem, how the integrity of the type of organization peculiar to the class of cold-blooded
vertebrata was maintained, and yet adapted by simple modifications to fulfil the conditions
required by the economy of a gigantic terrestrial reptile, destined to obtain support exclusively
from vegetable substances; in like manner as the extinct colossal sloth-like Edentata of South
America. In fine, we have in the Iguanodon the type of the terrestrial herbivora, which in that
remote epoch of the earth's physical history&mdash;the <i>Age of Reptiles</i>&mdash;occupied the same relative
station in the terrestrial fauna, and fulfilled the same general purposes in the economy of nature,
as the Mylodons, Mastodons, and Mammoths, of the tertiary periods, and the large pachyderms
of modern times.</p>

<p>Although some important data are still required to complete our knowledge of the structure
of the Iguanodon, we are warranted in concluding that this colossal herbivorous reptile was as
bulky as the elephant, and as massive in its proportions: for, living exclusively on vegetable
substances, the abdominal region must have been largely developed. Its limbs must have been
of proportionate size to support and move so enormous a carcass. The hinder extremities
probably presented the unwieldly contour of those of the Hippopotamus, and were based on
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[ 197 ]</a></span>
strong short feet, protected by broad horny ungueal phalanges, or nails. The fore-legs appear to
have been less bulky, and adapted for seizing and pulling down plants and branches: the
teeth and jaws demonstrate the nature of its food; and the fossil remains of coniferous trees,
arborescent, ferns, and cycadeous plants, with which its relics are commonly associated, indicate
the character of the flora adapted for its sustenance.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p><a id="SupNote_18">XVIII.</a> <span class="smcap">The Pelorosaurus.</span>&mdash;The humerus of a terrestrial reptile of enormous magnitude, has
lately been discovered by Mr. Peter Fuller of Lewes, in the quarry near Cuckfield, from which
many remains of the Iguanodon and Hylæosaurus were obtained in my early researches. This
bone more nearly resembles the humerus of the Crocodiles, than that of the Lizards. It Is four
and a half feet in length, and of corresponding proportions; it has a large medullary canal.
As to the size of the animal to which it belonged, while disclaiming the idea that any certain
conclusion can be drawn from a single bone, I may mention, with the view of conveying some
general notion, that in a Gangetic crocodile eighteen feet long, the humerus is one foot:
according to this scale the fossil animal would be eighty-one feet in length. I have proposed the
name of <i>Pelorosaurus</i> (from &#960;&#7953;&#955;&#969;&#961;&mdash;<i>pel&ograve;r</i>&mdash;monster), or Colossal-saurian, for this new genus of
reptiles which Inhabited the country of the Iguanodon.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_140" id="Footnote_140"></a><a href="#FNanchor_140"><span class="label">[140]</span></a> A memoir on this fossil was read before the Royal Society, Feb. 14th, 1850; an abstract has been published in the Proceedings
of the Society. It is entitled, "On the <span class="smcap">Pelorosaurus</span>; an undescribed gigantic terrestrial reptile, whose remains
are associated with those of the Iguanodon and other saurians in the strata of Tilgate Forest." It will appear in the Phil.

<p><a id="SupNote_19">XIX.</a> <span class="smcap">Silicification</span>, <i>or petrifaction by flint</i>.&mdash;The various forms in which silex occurs have
depended on its state of fluidity. In quartz crystals the solution was complete; in agate
and chalcedony it was in a gelatinous state, assuming a spheroidal or orbicular disposition
according to the motion given to its particles. Its condition appears also to have been modified
by the influence of organic matter. In some polished slices of siliceous nodules, the transition
from flint to agate, chalcedony, and crystallized quartz, is beautifully shown. The curious
fact that the shells of Echinites In chalk are almost invariably filled with flint, while their
crustaceous shells are changed into calc-spar, is probably in many instances to be attributed
to the animal matter having undergone silicification; for the most organized parts are those
which appear to have been most susceptible of this transmutation. In some specimens the
oyster is changed into flint, while the shell Is converted into crystallized carbonate of lime. In
a trigonia from Tisbury, formerly In the cabinet of the late Miss Benett, of Norton House, near
Warminster, the body of the mollusk was completely metamorphosed into pure chalcedony, the
branchiæ or gills being as clearly defined as when the animal was recent. In specimens of wood
from Australia (presented to the British Museum by Sir Thomas Mitchell), which are completely
permeated by silex, there are on the external surface some spots of chalcedony, that have
apparently originated from the exudation of the liquid silex from the interior in viscid globules
filled with air, which burst, and then collapsed, and became solidified in their present form.</p>

<p>In silicified wood, the permeation of the vegetable tissues by the mineral matter appears
to have been effected by solutions of silex of a high temperature. In some examples mineralization
has been effected simply by replacement: the original substance has been removed, atom
by atom, and the silex substituted in its place. One of the most eminent naturalists and mineralogists
of the United States, Mr. J. D. Dana,<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> suggests that the reason why silica is so common
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[ 198 ]</a></span>
a material in the constitution of fossil wood and shells, as well as in pseudo-morphic crystals,<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
consists in the ready solution of silex in water at a high temperature (a fact affirmed by
Bergman<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>) under great pressure, whenever an alkali is present, as is seen at the present time
in many volcanic regions, and its ready deposition again when the water cools. A mere
heated aqueous solution of silica, under a high pressure, is sufficient to explain the phenomenon
of the silicification of organic structures. Mr. Dana states that "a crystal of calc-spar in
such a fluid, being exposed to solution from the action of the heated water alone, the silica
deposits itself gradually on a reduction of temperature, and takes the place of the lime, atom by
atom, as soon as set free. Every silicified fossil is an example of this pseudo-morphism;
but there seems to be no union of the silica with the lime, for silicate of lime is of rare
occurrence."<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p><a id="SupNote_20">XX.</a> <span class="smcap">Stigmaria, Sigillaria,</span> &amp;c.&mdash;The most remarkable peculiarity of the flora of the carboniferous
period is the immense numerical preponderance of the vascular or higher tribes of cryptogamic
plants, which amount to two-thirds of the species described. With these are associated a
few Palms, Coniferæ, Cycadeæ, and dicotyledonous plants, allied to the <i>Cacteæ</i> and <i>Euphorbiaceæ</i>.
The number and magnitude of the vegetables bearing an analogy to the <i>Ductulosæ</i>, but differing
from existing species and genera, constitute therefore the most important botanical feature of
the carboniferous flora. Thus we have plants allied to the Equisetum, or mare's-tail (<i>Calamites</i>),
eighteen inches in circumference, and from thirty to forty feet high; Zamia-like coniferæ
(<i>Sigillariæ</i>) fifty feet high; and arborescent club-mosses (<i>Lepidodendra</i>) attaining an altitude
of sixty or seventy feet. Of this ancient flora, the fossil plants whose stems have been named
<i>Sigillaria</i> (see <a href="#Plate_21">Plate XXI.</a>), and their roots Stigmaria, are especially remarkable in consequence
of the peculiar circumstances under which upright examples of these trees are occasionally
met with. Referring for details to "Wonders of Geology," Lecture VII., I purpose describing
in this place the facts recently brought to light, which prove that certain species of Stigmaria
are the roots of Sigillariæ; while others in all probability belong to Lepidodendra:&mdash;an opinion
maintained more than thirty years ago by the Rev. H. Steinhauer.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> To the late Mr. Binney
we are indebted for the first confirmation of the inference of my friend, M. Adolphe Brongniart,
(derived from an examination of the structure of those bodies,) that the Stigmariæ are the veritable
roots of Sigillariæ. At St. Helen's, near Liverpool, Mr. Binney discovered, in 1844, an upright
trunk of a Sigillaria, nine feet high, to which were attached ten roots, several feet long,
that extended into the under clay in their natural position;<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> and these roots were unquestionable
Stigmariæ, the tubercles with their attached rootlets being clearly displayed.
In the floor of the Victoria Mine at Dunkinfold, near Manchester, at the depth of 1,100 feet
from the surface, Mr. Binney also discovered a magnificent specimen of Sigillaria, which
exhibited on its stem the respective characters of three supposed species, and had stigmaria-roots
extending twenty feet.</p>

stems of Sigillariæ and Lepidodendra, with stigmaria-roots attached; and the same fact has been

abounding in foliage and fragments of branches. As the coal is dug out, large masses of the
shale fall in, and occasionally hollow spaces, called by the workmen <i>pot-holes</i>, are left in the roof;
the fallen masses being the roots and truncated stems of Sigillariæ and other trees, which
separate at the parting formed by the coaly bark covering the roots, when the supporting coal
is removed.</p>

<p>The following sketch represents one of the specimens of the base of a stem of a Lepidodendron,
with the roots (<i>stigmariæ</i>) attached. This figure (1) shows the position of the tree above the bed
of main coal, with the inclination and length of two of the principal roots, so far as they could be
distinctly traced; and the following sketch (2) represents the trunk, with its branching roots,
constructed from careful measurements of the dimensions and position of each root, drawn on the
spot. The stem at the part marked A, was encrusted with a coaly bark, covered by the usual
cicatrices of the Lepidodendra, and the roots at B, C, D, with a similar carbonaceous investment,
impressed with the characteristic pits or areolæ of Stigmariæ.</p>

<p>In the Instance of the upright stems of Sigillariæ in the same coal-field, the roots were also
unequivocally Stigmariæ. Fig. 3, represents one of these erect stems, sixteen Inches high and
twelve inches in diameter at the top, which dropped from the roof of the bed after the coal had
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[ 200 ]</a></span>
been removed. Part of the coaly bark remains at <i>c</i>. The decorticated part of the trunk is covered
with minute scales as far as the point <i>h</i>, a few inches below the first ramification of the roots.
The carbonaceous crust investing the roots was thick at the upper part, but gradually became
thin, and at <i>a</i>, and <i>b</i>, was a mere friable pellicle, that fell off upon the slightest touch.</p>

<p>The exact position of the tree in relation to the underlying coal is shown in the above section.
Fig. 4. Immediately over the coal there is a bed of hard shale, six inches in depth, in which no
fossils are found; this is overlaid by a softer shale abounding in coal-plants; all the upright
stems were rooted in the six-inch shale. Upon clearing the base of this tree, a complete set of
conical tap-roots was discovered, arranged as in the annexed sketch. Fig. 5. There are four large
tap-roots in each quarter of the stump, and five inches below these another set of smaller tap-roots;
the total number amounting to eighteen. The horizontal roots are seen to branch off in
a regular manner, the base being divided into four nearly equal parts by deep channels, extending
from the centre to the points <i>i, k, l, m</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown remarks, that these short thick tap-roots were evidently adapted only to a soft
wet soil, such as we may conceive was the nature of the first layer of mud deposited upon a bed
of peat which had settled down slightly below the level
of the water. He supposes, from the presence of a
layer of shale without fossil plants immediately over
the coal, that the prostrate stems and leaves which
occur in such large quantities in the next superincumbent
bed, fell from trees growing on the spot, and were
entombed in layers of mud held in suspension in the
water, which at short intervals inundated the low
marshy ground on which they grew; for had the
plants been drifted from a distance, he conceives they
would also occur in the first layer of shale, as well as
in those higher up.</p>

</div>

<p>Having thus shown that the <i>Sigillaria alternans</i>
was provided with roots adapted for a soft muddy soil,
Mr. Brown next describes the specimen represented in
Fig. 6, which is the stem of the same species of tree
broken off near the roots; the hollow cylinder of bark (<i>a</i>) having been bent down and doubled
over by the pressure of the surrounding mud, so as effectually to close up the aperture, leaving
only a few irregular cicatrices, of three or four inches in length, converging at the apex; the
structure, arrangement, and number of the tap-roots, as well as the horizontal ramifications, are
similar to those in Fig. 5. This fossil clearly explains the nature of the "<i>dome-shaped</i>" plant
figured in the "Fossil Flora of Great Britain."<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_148" id="Footnote_148"></a><a href="#FNanchor_148"><span class="label">[148]</span></a> The figures 3, 4, 5, 6, and the descriptions, are from the paper of Richard Brown, Esq., published in the Journal of the
Geological Society of London, for March, 1849, entitled, "Description of erect Sigillariæ, with conical tap-roots, found in
the roof of the Sydney Main Coal, in the Island of Cape Breton."</p></div>

<p>"The roots of the preceding fossils repeatedly ramify as their distance from the stem
increases, and ultimately terminate in broad flattened points. The whole of the spreading roots
of these trees (the <i>Sigillariæ</i>) cover only an area of thirty square feet each; whilst those of the
Lepidodendron (Fig. 1), whose stem is only two or three inches larger in diameter, covered
a space of two hundred square feet. Since it is well known, from numerous examples, that the
<span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[ 202 ]</a></span>
Lepidodendra were lofty trees, with spreading branches, which therefore required wide bases for
support, may we not conclude that Sigillariæ of the species described were, on the contrary, trees
of low stature, without heavy branches?"</p>

<p>I cannot quit this subject without again adverting to the remarkable phenomenon mentioned
In a previous note, namely, that in the bed of pulverulent earth&mdash;the <i>under-clay</i>&mdash;on which the
coal invariably reposes, the roots (or Stigmariæ) of large trees are generally the only organic
remains met with. The constant occurrence of these fossils in the under-clay, and their rarity in
the coal and shale, was long ago pointed out by Mr. Martin, Dr. Macculloch, and other geologists;
but the importance of the fact was not appreciated till Mr. Logan drew attention to it. In the
Welsh coal-field, through a depth of 1,200 feet, there are sixty beds of coal, each of which lies on
a stratum of clay abounding in Stigmariæ. In the Appalachian coal formation of the United
States, the same phenomena occur.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that the under-clay is the natural soil in which the roots (<i>Stigmariæ</i>) of the
Sigillariæ and Lepidodendra grew; the coal above it is composed of the carbonized stems and
foliage of those trees; and the roof or coal-shale is formed by the leaves and branches of a forest
overwhelmed and buried beneath the transported detritus of distant rocks. These phenomena may
be explained by supposing that a plain, densely clothed with a luxuriant intertropical vegetation,
was either inundated by an irruption of the sea, or overwhelmed by a flood, from the sudden
breaking up of the barrier of an inland lake; or by the subsidence of the country on which the
forests grew. But when we find an uninterrupted series, in which triple deposits of this
character are repeated through many thousand feet, the solution of the problem is beset with
difficulties, which the hypothesis of repeated periodical subsidences, however ingenious, does
not, in my opinion, remove.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

struck off, I have, through the kindness and liberality of <span class="smcap">Samuel H. Beckles</span>, Esq., of Hastings,
obtained two portions of jaws from the Wealden of the Sussex Coast. One of these is a fragment
of the left side of the lower jaw, with six well-defined dental sockets; the other specimen
exhibits the position of the mature molars and the successional teeth in the upper jaw; and
confirms the accuracy of the views of Dr. Melville and myself as to the ruminant character of
the arrangement of the dental organs in the upper and lower jaws of the Iguanodon, as described
in my memoir on the structure of the jaws and teeth; Philos. Trans. 1848, p. 183. When this
specimen is completely developed, it will probably exhibit distinctly the relative position of the
germs and mature teeth, and the form of the inner alveolar parapet.</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
